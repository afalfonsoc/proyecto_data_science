"Sickened by Putin's genocide, why didn't the West go into Ukraine to help them? Where is our empathy?",0,twztp8,RussiaUkraineWar2022,https://www.reddit.com/r/RussiaUkraineWar2022/comments/twztp8/sickened_by_putins_genocide_why_didnt_the_west_go/,251,"Seeing the **images** of tied up executed people, reports of men tortured, raped women, children killed, etc. I cannot fathom it. It's shamefully disgusting, do Russians not see what they're doing is reaching  to a Nanjing massacre level?

Besides, *what exactly has to happen to a human for them to become so spiritually sick that they'd willing commit such atrocities?*

Finally, why did our governments in the West not go in and meet Russia's army in Ukraine? We could have prevented this by pushing Russia's weak army out. Putin is crazy, but I'm sure even he realizes that a nuclear war would be suicide and the end of life on earth. I suspect even he wishes to live. We were cowardly and stood by in fear whilst innocent people got massacred. It's better to die standing up to a big bully than to let the bully kill us off one by one.

It's so sad to see what is happening and to think our governments had such a weak response. Also to see some making excuses for that weak response. It's hard not to look at the videos of innocent Ukrainians killed, the tears, and to think how I would feel if I were Ukrainian: I would feel abandoned by the world.

*“The only thing necessary for the triumph of evil is for good men to do nothing,”*

**EDIT: To the billion replies saying ""blah nukes blah"". If Russia invaded Alaska, I guarantee you the USA would have no problem bringing the war to Russia. The reason the USA (and Canada, where I live) don't give a flip, is because it's not us. We have become self-centred beyond all measure.**

I have noticed that we are dehumanizing others…,0,xp984u,RussiaUkraineWar2022,https://www.reddit.com/r/RussiaUkraineWar2022/comments/xp984u/i_have_noticed_that_we_are_dehumanizing_others/,198,"I have noticed more and more that we (the pro Ukraine folks) have been dehumanizing the enemy more and more. It is getting pretty ugly. 

It is crossing a line that the Kremlin itself has already done. Heck, the primary wrong committed by the Kremlin and its supporters is the dehumanization of Ukraine (and others). It is at the root of the aggression.

War is evil and we should be cautious not to invite ever more evil into our own hearts and minds. At some point this thing will end, Ukraine will be rebuilt and Russia will have to re-enter the international arena. Criminals will need to be brought to justice.  Ut the rest of us will need to figure out how to move forward. Otherwise this is but a chapter in a story defined by the horrific evils of war. 

This war is particularly ugly; it is fratricidal. Many Ukrainians work(ed) in Russia, a great many families were “blended.” There is a common faith shared by many of the people on both sides. A great and unnecessary evil has been brought by Putin and his allies, enablers and supporters. 

We should be cautious to not irrecoverably poison our own hearts and preclude any sort of reconciliation when this shitstorm is over.",1664261735.0

Isolating all russians in Russia regardless of their political beliefs is bad idea.

It's hopeless to protest somehow and change life in Russia for better. I understand how Zelenskiy feels extremely bad and he is a human with emotions. According to The Washington Post, Zelenskiy wants to send all russians on planet to Russia and he hopes that it will change for better.

Guys, I talked with oppositioneers and most of them are just sitting on homes and praying to ukrainian soldiers for a victory. They understand that they CAN'T DO ANYTHING. If you think that they will make a revolution like they did in late 20s of 20th century you're wrong unless Russia lose the war. We are not living in Hollywood blockbuster about Resistance fighting against tyrannical government.

I think we should to evacuate all russians, who are against Putin, from Russia so they could protest freely and start a new better life. They of course, can emigrate to other post-soviet countries, but it's difficult for them due to high prices and bureacratic things. So, if situation will not get better, anti-putinist russians will in one day give up and go into despair. They just become apathetic doomers or, either way, kill themselves so they could ""emigrate"" to afterlife.

Maybe we need a special psychological test, examine everything about russian emigrant who want to leave his country and etc. Also, I talked with oppositioneers in TJournal and they are not happy how Zelensky calls to send and isolate all russians.

I’m also sick of reading the likes of “Russians risk imprisonment, torture, and death if they protest against their government”. 

—

The consequence of Russian nationals failing to protest and failing to modify their government [to halt hostilities] is by default, causing loss of human life outside their domain.

If Russians truly want peace, they must be willing to face the risks of war. The same risks Ukrainians have been facing: Death, torture, and imprisonment; until cessation of hostilities and the complete expulsion of Russian Armed Forces in Ukraine.

Hard assistance from NATO cannot be provided to Ukraine as the world would risk a nuclear war initiated by Russia. This is a fight between the people of Ukraine and the Russian Federation (which includes Belarus)

The people of Russia must assume the incredible risks that come with war. If not, they must be stripped of all luxuries and experiences of a modern human. I support every sanction that impacts the “average” Russian citizen.

If the population of Russia fails to respect the current state of events and do not assume responsibilities, the net punishment of the Russian Federation should be that of a weakened and desperate people with Putin’s existing government in hopes to mitigate the cycle of Russian aggression.",1646108265.0

Have some humanity,330,votr9f,RussiaUkraineWar2022,https://www.reddit.com/r/RussiaUkraineWar2022/comments/votr9f/have_some_humanity/,421,"I don't use Reddit very often at all, and I will not attribute this behaviour to reddit users themselves for the meme. I do lurk around every now and then though and I feel the need to share my (sadly) uncommon perspective.

I'd like to make the perfect example of a post from a day ago, titled ""Russian soldier denazifies himself"" with a picture of a russian soldier holding a rifle in a pool of blood with a bullet hole in his head. Does talking about the loss of a human life like this not absolutely revolt you?

Yes, russian troops kill, rape, destroy, etc. But does that excuse celebration of the fact that some are dying in these dire, depressing conditions? A lot of them don't even want to be on the battlefield. They know they're fighting for the wrong cause, yet their rivals are praised whenever they commit the same kind of senseless murder against them. Yes, it's to defend their homeland. But taking a picture next to a man whos family just lost someone they loved is disgusting no matter the context.

If a soldier (doesn't matter the side) who has raped and murdered women and children in a war takes his own life, I'd struggle to feel a lot of sympathy but I absolutely would not celebrate it. I would never celebrate the shortcomings of the world order that allowed everything to happen in the first place.

Ukrainian red cross has recieved $9.8 million to date since the beginning of the war, yet when keyboard warriors get the opportunity to act cool and badass by cracking jokes about countless people and families ravaged by the war, they're first in line. It's a curious case and if you're one of these people I'd suggest you take what I said into consideration or at the very least have a conversation with me if you disagree.

EDIT: My main point is if you revel in seeing a dead Russian soldier with no prior context, I'd argue you're the same propagator of violence you describe them as (albeit, obviously lesser, but still you are one)",1656656002.0

"70.000 protesters in Prague against Czech government, EU and NATO",0,x5vs26,RussiaUkraineWar2022,https://www.reddit.com/r/RussiaUkraineWar2022/comments/x5vs26/70000_protesters_in_prague_against_czech/,25,"PRAGUE, Sept 3 (Reuters) - An estimated **70,000** people protested in Prague against the Czech government on Saturday, calling on the ruling coalition to do more to control soaring energy prices and voicing opposition to the European Union and NATO.

[ Wenceslas Square, Prague](https://preview.redd.it/lqbtskmcawl91.png?width=621&format=png&auto=webp&s=e1645f1137306b72939dd2f20b50ed74e49954db)

Organisers of the demonstration from a number of far-right and fringe political groups including the Communist party, said the central European nation should be neutral militarily and ensure direct contracts with gas suppliers, including Russia.

Police estimates put the number of protesters at around **70,000** by mid-afternoon.

""The aim of our demonstration is to demand change, mainly in solving the issue of energy prices, especially electricity and gas, which will destroy our economy this autumn,"" event co-organizer Jiri Havel told iDNES.cz news website.

The protest at Wenceslas Square in the city centre was held a day after the government survived a no-confidence vote amid opposition claims of inaction against inflation and energy prices.

The vote showed how Europe's energy crisis is fuelling political instability as soaring power prices stoke inflation, already at levels unseen in three decades.

Prime Minister Petr Fiala, who leads the centre-right, five-party coalition, told CTK news service on Saturday that the protesters did not have the country's best interests at heart.

""The protest on Wenceslas Square was called by forces that are pro-Russian, are close to extreme positions and are against the interests of the Czech Republic,"" he said.

The rally, part-organised by the far-right Freedom and Direct Democracy party (SPD) and the rump Communist party that once ruled the former Czechoslovakia, featured calls for military neutrality and complaints over the arrival of Ukrainian refugees. About 400,000 have been granted residence in the Czech Republic since Russia invaded Ukraine.

Alongside banners bearing slogans such as “The best for Ukrainians and two jumpers for us”, Zuzana Majerová Zahradníková of the hard-right, anti-EU Trikolora party told protesters: “Fiala’s government may be Ukrainian, it may be Brussels, but it is definitely not Czech.”

Some demonstrators wore T-shirts praising the Russian president, Vladimir Putin, while others carried banners voicing anti-EU and anti-Nato sentiment. The Czech Republic has been among the western alliance’s staunchest supporters of Ukraine.

Organisers have vowed to stage further rallies, with another planned for the symbolic date of 28 September, Czech state day, unless the government resigns by 25 September.

Fiala, the leader of the Civic Democratic party (ODS) and a former politics professor, dismissed the demonstration as extremist and fuelled by Russian propaganda.

He is already careful in not saying ""war"" and is aware of his phone being scanned.  He'll be wiping our chat history if/when he makes his move.  I do not know if the borders are closed, and he doesn't want to admit to any Russian group he's LGBT as they aren't nice about it.

I didn't mention this part to him as to not create more worry, but when things start to go bad like failing/losing a war, the leaders of that side rally the people by blaming some minority group as the fault.  Hitler blamed the Jews and LGBT for WWI if I'm not mistaken.  We see it in the US too often as well.

Where can he go to get out of Russia and in theory come to the US?  


Edit: This is a difficult situation as I can't find where to contact.  I had similar difficulties in friends I have in Afghanistan who were left after everyone left.

 produce hilarious results. Trolls usually have no political compass or agenda other than than to throw a monkey-wrench in anyone's self-serving function. And most of the results of trolling is relatively harmless.  (relatively)

Orcs try to do what trolls do but they suck at it or are much less effective. Because they're easily spotted in their attempts and/or totally uninspired.

Everybody should be making the conscious effort to make a change to the way they live as a direct result of what is going on in Ukraine and Russia... change my mind,0,tawash,RussiaUkraineWar2022,https://www.reddit.com/r/RussiaUkraineWar2022/comments/tawash/everybody_should_be_making_the_conscious_effort/,9,"Excuse the essay in advance. I'm not sure if this sub is exactly the right place for this, since it's not DIRECTLY discussing the conflict in Ukraine, however, in my mind it is regarding the global war effort in regards to this conflict, so I wasn't sure where else to post.

With the massive inflation, energy crisis and inevitable housing shortages, reduction in accessibility to food that comes as a direct result of the conflic and resultant sanctions placed on one another by the ""West"" and Russia, I am compelled in my believe that we have passed the point of putting off change. Throw in the environmental crisis and the outlook on the future of the globe seems pretty dismal, and this will happen whether nukes are used or not. In WW2 people were forced to sacrifice comfort and commodities for the greater good. Blackouts were used to help hide cities from aerial bombers. People were encouraged to grow their own veg and limit their use of resources... whether or not you believe it is hyperbole to call this conflict a world war at this point is kind of irrelevant when you look at the bigger picture, at least in my opinion. 

I fear that without some major change in the way the west chooses to live (with it's head in the sand, putting off sacrifice and making hard decisions with regards to compromising our gluttony and greed for wealth and commodity), we will one day sooner than we think be forced into an existential crisis. Just look at how our dependence on Russian oil and gas all this time and our willful ignorance of the red flags from Putin have lead to an energy crisis we have little way of dealing with. What's to stop China doing what Putin is doing to Ukraine in Taiwan and holding pretty much the entire globe hostage? How will we possibly be able to live without china's exports? I am all for the global community. I am all for mixing our cultures, races, sharing supplies and things, but our DEPENDANCY on ONE global autocratic power makes us weak. 

Surely governments across the globe should now be looking at this situation and saying things like ""the time has come for us to take the leap and become greener faster than we have ever planned before"" or ""these are war times... we have to make sacrifices and curb the situation through limiting our consumption of energy until it is under control"". Of course this could literally be years of sacrifice, but if we want the world to have a future, we need to take the leap, right? I mean, global overpopulation is a MASSIVE issue and we see it in the epicly scaled housing crises in europe... water shortages in Mexico and other parts of the world... mass migration from Africa and the Middle east...

I had some hope at the start of the coronavirus pandemic that everything shutting down would allow people to take stock and realise the damage we are doing to ourselves and our environment, but if anything, online consumerism skyrocketed, making rich corporations and individuals even richer and normal people weaker and poorer. China had all the control of PPE, having created a monopoly on medical equipment manufacture and the world was essentially at their mercy. Plastic consumption and waste is through the roof, and still, we do nothing but make empty pledges of ""mañana.. or by the year 2050"". Give me a break!!!

This war in Ukraine is a direct result of us and our governments doing just that... stagnation and inaction. We did nothing to protect our neighbour Ukraine before it was too late. Even after Crimea, the west made excuses as to why dealing with the despotic maniac was OK whilst the internet was busy meming fucking ""wide putin"" and russian chadness. 

 I know that this issue is far more complex than just saying ""peace and love! Why can't we all just get along?!"" or ""well let's just switch to renewables and manufacture all our own produce and medical supplies and be independentand save the environment in the process"". We are a global civilisation at the end of the day. It has the potential to be so powerful if we all work together and all give eachother what we need and want, but unfortunately the world is a world of inequity and struggle. We have nations that (as we see in the likes of North Korea, Russia, China and many, many others) that there is simply no negotiation with. Is America even that different to them really in terms of doing the best for it's people or the environment? Everything is relative and we all want freedom of choice, but we are sadly headed headfirst into our demise with our pace of change.

Everything starts with the individual and I think we all have to start seriously making changes and hard decisions for ourselves rather than waiting on our governments to do it for us or force our hands when it's already too late.

Forgive the rant, there is so much more I have on my mind about this and my heart bleeds for Ukraine. I'm filled with so much guilt and fear over the situation and despite my best efforts I can't seem to pull myself out of crippling depression, sense of hopelessness and an impending sense of doom since it all kicked off.

NATO does not Owe Ukraine its Salvation,368,ta949s,RussiaUkraineWar2022,https://www.reddit.com/r/RussiaUkraineWar2022/comments/ta949s/nato_does_not_owe_ukraine_its_salvation/,426," 

NATO is a defensive alliance among 30  nation states that provides an umbrella of security to over one Billion  citizens. Ukraine is not part of that alliance.

Some  very harsh truths to follow, please keep in mind that while you might  down vote this it does not change the reality and the truth of this  matter, please also note that I fucking hate Putin for what he has done  to Ukraine.

However, the harsh  reality is that Ukraine is not a NATO member, it is not therefore  granted the protections of Article 5, that an attack on one is an attack  on all. NATO owes Ukraine absolutely nothing yet has provided weapons,  training, funding, intelligence, and refuge to those who seek it along  with massively damaging economic sanctions against Russia that will hurt  NATO states.  NATO has done as much as it can short of getting into  direct combat operations against Russian forces.

NATO  cannot and should NOT escalate any further in Ukraine, NATO has pushed  to the very brink of war with Russia as such it cannot escalate further,  that means NATO cannot provide a no-fly zone, it can’t give real time  intelligence for targeting and it can’t just drop off a few dozen MIGs.  To do so would be seen as an act of War by NATO against Russia, there  has to be a line and its quite clear where that line is.

Make  no mistake, a war between Russia and NATO is  WW3, it’s a very short  nuclear war and after it nation states will most likely no longer exist  in most parts of Europe. Ukraine might be hurting right now but it pales  in comparison to the hurt that comes with a nuclear war.

NATO  does not owe Ukraine the existence of its 30 nation state member or the  lives of all those who live in under its protection.

With putin restricting the Internet, their economy in shambles, and hundreds of companies abandoning the country, is it not possible that (whenever and however this ends) Russia will sit, becoming bitter, isolated, until it eventually gains a new ruler who blames the west, etc, etc and we just end up with Ww2 Germany again?

Russia's conclusion has to be ""We wish, we had never done that, let us never do that again"", and absolutely not ""A hard fight, but ultimately worth it, let us prepare better next time"". Obviously this result should be obtained as soon as possible and the way to do it is to expand the support Ukraine gets e.g. in the field of artillery to all types of military equipment.

Ukraine is said to have manpower, but lack vehicles

This is foremost Europes problem, so Western European countries should invest in their own future wellbeing and peace and **provide 10% worth of their current stock in any vehicle category** to Ukraine. Roughly with artillery it was done (e.g. Germany has 108 PzH2000 in service and provided 10 to Ukraine). Let's distribute other peoples stuff and take a look at current inventories of three major European countries:

[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List\_of\_equipment\_of\_the\_French\_Army](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_equipment_of_the_French_Army)

[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List\_of\_equipment\_of\_the\_British\_Army](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_equipment_of_the_British_Army)

[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List\_of\_modern\_equipment\_of\_the\_German\_Army](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_modern_equipment_of_the_German_Army)

I will set up somewhat arbitrary vehicle categories to keep things simple (do not bash me for faulty allocation), the numbers are from the above WIKI links

Rules: ""we will allow""

* ... exempting equipment from transferral if it is deemed dangerous to let it fall into Russian hands (reverse engineering). The total numbers of transferrals has to be kept
* ... swapping of deliveries between countries , to ease logistics for Ukrainians and to compensate for exemptions
* ... swapping between vehicle types but only on per weight base, same total vehicle weight in other categories would have to be delivered

**MBTs**

[MBT inventory of Britain, France, Germany](https://preview.redd.it/m1y4q99oiwj91.png?width=755&format=png&auto=webp&s=a5d751db6cef0d4678c4f260c8c5a86f56427f2f)

The three Western countries between them have 715 active MBTs, they would have to provide 71 to Ukraine. 263 are sitting in storage, in the British case the decision to reduce may not have aged well, but no correction is currently known, the French could draw the ""too modern"" card. But we have a wildcard, there are Leopard 2A4 in industry possession from which the German buildup and also some compensations for donors of Soviet style equipment is drawn. Unfortunately I do not know the extent of this stock, I have hearsay ""200"", which would be sufficient to fulfill the quota even after deducting German buildup and compensation.

**IFVs**

[IFV inventory of Britain, France, Germany](https://preview.redd.it/tokeznoqiwj91.png?width=755&format=png&auto=webp&s=682e0c0f4d9f0f615cc28e68b3cd3f1752c213dd)

I believe this is the most interesting vehicle category for Ukraine, Western IFVs weighing 25+ tons presumably more robust than the BMP-stype Soviet equipment, would augment Ukraines strength in infantry well.

The three countries have a total of 1745 of those vehicles in service, resulting in 174 to be delivered to Ukraine under the 10% suggestion. French VBCI and German Puma can pull the ""too modern"" card. But Britain has an exceptionally high number of Warriors compared with the other countries and they are already scheduled for replacement, In Germany the remaining Marders are already in the process of being replaced by Puma with the Puma production line already running. From WIKI it seems that the Warrior unfortunately does not have an ATGM, while the Marder's ammo for the main gun is blocked because of Swiss origin. I do not think that the Ukrainians would be picky in this regard, the Marder ammo problem should be solvable in the time which would be consumed by training crews, a replacement for the much more complex AA munitions for the Gepard was also found. Total pool is 1086. If you cannot decide between Marder and Warrior, hint: 10% is just an orientation, generosity is always allowed.

**AFVs**

[AFV inventory of Britain, France, Germany](https://preview.redd.it/kpat0ceviwj91.png?width=756&format=png&auto=webp&s=7a152804974f3fb4c47a677d7d301880ec0fb8ff)

Vehicles of this category were already delivered by Britain (some CVRT), although the replacement project is currently stalled. France and Germany are exposed here with vehicles which already have planned replacements. France could provide Ukraine with AMX 10RCR as Jaguars are coming in and Germany could provide some Wiesels which are already scheduled for replacement by Boxers. The three countries have a total inventory of 1325, the resulting 132 deliveries to Ukraine should be manageable, here a mix would be nice the candidates have diverting mission profiles.

**APCs**

[APC inventory of Britain, France, Germany](https://preview.redd.it/w43a6psyiwj91.png?width=756&format=png&auto=webp&s=80819c78547fb2bd0a8bb3a55c84d34703df209a)

Again deliveries in this category did already take place (French VAB), the three countries together have 4154 vehicles of this category, all except for the VAB could pull the ""too modern"" exemption. Fortunately the VAB is available in large numbers and the replacement already in production with a considerable number already delivered.

Will such a delivery diminish Western European security? I do not think so, unless the Ukrainians ""waste"" the vehicles and the Russians attack. Wasting seems highly unlikely and proper usage would further (!) deteriorate Russian capabilities to attack somewhere else. Ukraine already pushed down Russia's army far more than 10%, why not let them participate in the security gain resulting from those efforts?

**Distributing other peoples stuff**

* Germany should flush the remainder of it's secret cache of Leopard 2A4s
* Germany and Britain should provide the IFVs, a conversion of the MBTs in case the aforementioned cache is empty at a per weight base would be beneficial, because tank deliveries are already quite substantial
* AFV should be delivered as a mix from all three countries (different vehicle profiles)
* France provides the APCs

For a fair share of sacrifice a little bit shuffling between Britain and Germany might be necessary.

For reference a list of current deliveries to Ukraine from the well known ORYX site.

[https://www.oryxspioenkop.com/2022/04/answering-call-heavy-weaponry-supplied.html](https://www.oryxspioenkop.com/2022/04/answering-call-heavy-weaponry-supplied.html)

Here you can see that delivered IFVs are only of the BMP-derivatives up to 15t of weight, small number compared to MBTs, here balancing should be provided.

Hint: It would be allowed to be generous and provide more, and other countries can join in, I think everything would be appreciated e.g. even the assumed scrap-metal-grade Spanish Leopard 2A4 as paperweight.",1661451777.0

I did not open all the windows, but the rest of the armed forces are pretty consistent too.  
Now, after losing something like 25.000 soldiers and more than 400 tanks, still you can read from the screenshot that the active military personnel is around **1.000.000 units** and tanks are still **12.000 units**.  
Some people, and some news articles, say that Russia now is running out of weapons. Well, it does not look like to me. I guess the immense Russian borders need to be secured with active military positions here and there, but 3000 tanks and some hundred thousands soldiers can still be sent to war, possibly to other fronts (i.e. Transnistria).  
So, where is the truth here? What are these numbers really saying?

1. All countries show their military strength to the entire world i.e. everyone sorta knows what each country have in their inventory  
Now an interesting thing to note here is, compared to world war 2, there hasn't been much innovation in military tech of what's shown to the public. **My 2 cent is every country are hiding their most advanced piece of tech (it's impossible for the military industry to have minor upgradation as to whats shown in their artilleries on shows)**
2. If point one is true then citizens need to be afraid of a much worse situation than a nuclear attack (cause no nation even opposition nations want that - its the end of the earth if a nuke is exploded by one country, the others will follow in response and the domino continuos)  
**I don't know what's on the table by any country but it's a mix of existing tech + sci-fi tech (at least some of what we have seen). It modern warfare with most of the inventions kept underground for the moment of wars.**   
*Members - What can you think of in terms of modern artillery, lets discuss*
3. Talking about this war, Russia is literally soft while attacking. We have seen Russia and their brutality. To understand this war its high time to understand how Putin thinks - As per my research, there are 2 aspects of his thinking.  
a. If Ukraine joins the NATO alliance, Russia can be infiltrated by NATO command anytime. The borders won't mater much and Russia wouldn't want that to happen  
b. Putin thinks of Ukrainians as Russians only (aah, this has been advertised so many times but its true)  


If this war involves alliances joining hands with either party, it's world war 3. Just one infiltration of any country joining either of the forces. Again a hypothesis, but no one would be able to stop it. If that happens, I can't imagine the future because I never gave a thought to any kind of war before (Gen Z).  


One of the countries should lay down if this has to end. People and social media are only provoking Putin to go all in and if that happens then it's *Catastrophe.*  Humans are going to see a lot of bloodshed and country and their alliances will go all in to stop Putin's governance (Again this triggers a world war)

Does anyone else think Russia's strategy for confronting NATO involves Russia capturing broad swaths of Central Asia as a precursor?,12,vuhuo6,RussiaUkraineWar2022,https://www.reddit.com/r/RussiaUkraineWar2022/comments/vuhuo6/does_anyone_else_think_russias_strategy_for/,35,"I hear a lot of talk from people in the Baltic states and Eastern Europe that Putin plans to capture those territories in the immediate future.  In my opinion, that isn't really possible, at least in the near future.  As it stands right now, Russia appears to have the capacity to capture the Donbas region, and I think that is where they will stop, at least for the time being.   If Russia really wanted to go all out and put their entire population on a war footing, they might be able to fight NATO, but I don't think the Russian top brass is interested in that yet.  

Russia currently uses it's DPR and LPR proxies in Ukraine to do a lot of the direct fighting, and also uses a lot of it's own ethnic minorities (largely from the Caucasus)  to do the rest.  Even that is a balancing game, because the Russian government realizes if the losses from those regions become to great, they could risk internal ethnic revolts which could become extremely dangerous.  Provincial Russians are also used in the war, but Putin realizes that ethnic Russian losses should be minimal in order to ensure complete Russian loyalty to the state and lessen the chances of the Russian masses becoming extremely against the regime.  

If Russia plans to confront NATO in Eastern Europe, I think the major thing to look out for beforehand would be increased Russian involvement in Central Asia.  I don't know how that would take place, whether they would directly invade, or somehow put pressure on Central Asian leaders to further integrate (particularly militarily) with Russia.  However, I believe that before Russians would take on NATO, they would want access to more cannon fodder.  Central Asia has about 70 million people (largely young and impoverished) and appears to be the easiest place to gain that.  They could then conscript soldiers from those regions, offer them money that would be considered a fortune in their impoverished, rural villages, and send them to the front while minimizing the need to recruit soldiers from the Russian heartland (or even the non ethnically Russian republics, who have already suffered heavy losses in Ukraine)",1657306194.0

It seems that since last year, she has forced Putin to switch to a diet of salads, greens and beetroot smoothies. Mentally devastated by the monotony of the regime, Putin went mad and finally decided to invade Ukraine.

&#x200B;

Kremlin sources say that on the morning of the invasion, Putin ordered two pieces of bacon, toast and a coffee, but just before his food arrived, his girlfriend appeared, who apostrophized him and placed a plate of raw carrots in front of him. lettuce and chia seeds hydrated with almond milk. At that moment, Putin exploded and ordered the tanks to advance.

&#x200B;

The most horrific moment was when Putin's girlfriend forbade him to order a pork neck with french fries at a restaurant in Moscow and ordered broccoli tempura with cashew sauce for him, and Putin threw it out of the car and called the generals, saying that they can also attack Ukrainian civilians.

Swapping in Ukraine's flag and insignia would not much change the picture, this looks like ...

This narrative is already pushed in Russia's news shows. One of the reasons for this push may even be to prevent the delivery, because of growing pressure.

Yeah, Germany again, but it would not get any better with a Bradley/Abrams, Warrior/Challenger 2  combination, maybe the French could get away with being experienced as a little less offensive with VBCI/Leclerc.

And I would do it anyway, because there are also positives, Ukraine would get another morale boost, Marders go further before being destroyed, that extra weight should have gone somewhere. Russia would be shown that the West is ready to go all the way and that they should not bank on falling Western weapons supply, which should alter their results. Finally the Russian population does not show much enthusiasm to throw themselves before an M113 derivative, this enthusiasm most likely will not increase when the vehicle in question is more than doubled in weight and augmented with a machine cannon and an ATGM launcher on top of an MG.",1663418019.0

Moscow imperialists can’t stand the thought of losing the war to Ukrainians. It means, to them, “Great Russians” being defeated by “Little Russians.”  That’s why it’s likely Muscovy will escalate against NATO. Not because they will win, but because they will lose to a peer.

Russia already attacked Poland using unconventional warfare. Putin puppet Lukashenka recruited a ""penal battalion"" of irregular migrants and pushed them over the border from Belarus.  Putin is a KGB man. He'll try to attack NATO indirectly, by using Belarusians or the Kadyrites.

Under no circumstances will Russia allow itself to lose to Ukraine. Russia will escalate the war so it can lose to NATO instead.

The U.S. and its allies won’t fight Russia’s invasion of Europe in Ukraine because of the “risk of WWIII.” But then they claim, incongruously, that they’ll defend a NATO country – where the risk is as great.  Naturally, Putin doesn’t believe the West will ever unite and fight.

Eight years since Russia invaded Ukraine and 26 days since the current offensive started,  there’s no excuse for the U.S. and its allies to remain stuck in a dangerous world of illusions about Russia as a peer power.  Refusing to fight Russia in Ukraine guarantees escalation.

In Ukraine Russia can't escalate the ground war. Russian forces are struggling on many fronts, including routine supply lines and logistics, they are out of food and fuel.  So their only option is to intensify the airstrikes at nite, from 200 sorties to 300, only to demolish Ukrainian cities as much they can.  

There's no chance that weak-assed sanctions will topple Putin and end the war. The Russians get around $1.1 billion a day to finance their invasion of Europe from EU countries, in exchange for oil and gas.  Only defeating the Russian invasion army in battle will bring victory.

Following the ongoing war against Russia, I want to react to this.
First of all, I condemn the Russian government, Donetsk separatists,  Luhansk separatists and everyone else supporting and defending Russia and it's allies for this inhumane war.
May they pay their prize one day and have a suitable punishment for this.
I cannot still believe that there's a war going on in Europe including Ukraine and I feel sorry to all victims of the war.
I've respect to the Ukrainian Army, because they're fighting for their country, the territorial integrity, culture, values and people.
I've also respect for the Ukrainian people because they're living in uncertainty and in tough times but still they're motivated because they believe this all will end well but also because the hell and pain they need to endure right now because of the war.
I've respect for the Ukrainian government too, because they're leading Ukraine, it's people and army during challenging times.
I'm glad that many people including me and countries are standing with Ukraine and are helping them and I want to let this continue because this is important for Ukraine.
I hope that the victory will be for Ukraine or that there will be peace there and the territorial integrity will be respected, that Ukraine will be restored one day as it was before the war and also that all occupied territories rightfully belonging to Ukraine will be returned to Ukraine.
I also hope that the Ukrainians can live in peace and safety without fear and concerns one day.

As last, I want to say:
- Crimea is Ukraine!
- Donetsk is Ukraine!
- Luhansk is Ukraine!

I respect the territorial integrity of Ukraine and recognize these territories only as part of Ukraine.
 
This was all I wanted to say about the war in Ukraine, may fortune, luck, prosperity and peace with you.

Слава Україні! Героям слава!/Glory to Ukraine, glory to the heroes! 👍💛💙🇺🇦

**Dear Pre 24 Feb Putin**

The corruption that has been so rampant during your dictatorship has hollowed out your military capability to a much greater extent than you could understand. The slavish yes men who are your military leadership don’t have the guts to inform you that the invasion of Ukraine is destined to fail spectacularly.  The once feared Russian army will become the laughing stock of the world driven by abject military failure, ridiculous attempts at propaganda, and the obvious amazement that your people have over simple things such as washing machines, toilets and mattresses, that seemingly are not available in Russia and hence need to be stolen. The atrocious disregard for human life and war crimes committed by your army will be the start of a cold and bleak cultural “Russian  Winter” with Russia remaining cut off from the international community; and the West more united than ever. The thing that will begin to thaw the winter is when, having suffered horrendous losses in their communities and being starved of the benefits of the international economy; the people rise up, supported by the Oligarchs (who want their megayachts and private planes back) and end up determining that they are better off with you out of the picture. This single decision is the worst decision you could possibly make and is directly responsible for significantly shortening your life expectancy.

DON’T DO IT.

Putin has gone too far with some things but nobody is gonna officially step in to not create more issues. But considering Putins threats, his lack of decency for human life and damn near war crimes hes initiating, could a secret operation from different international operatives and militaries actually be able to work? Or would it be too risky to even attempt? Considering Russia has the most nuclear weapons and has their nuclear defense systems active, he's waiting for an opportunity. Say a bunch of operatives dressed in all black could pull off something like missile system disarming or even sweep through Ukraine in force taking care of the troops. Again it would be difficult especially if nearby countries aren't in on it, and whistle blowers are too prevalent to pull something like that off, not to mention putin isn't stupid and could probably figure out some countries that were involved and retaliation wouldn't be good.

Imposing  a no-fly zone is a scary step towards all-out WW3, and the only way of  physically stopping the Russian artillery seems to be air strikes.

Another, completely counter-intuitive idea.

The EU should offer to take all the Russian POWs the Ukrainians send them, and keep them till the end of the war.

Treat  them very well. Perhaps in a converted holiday resort. Good food, wine,  vodka, dances with girls; educational and training opportunities, good  healthcare.

Make sure they can  tell their families and friends and their old comrades where they are  and how good things are, and how much better it is than sitting in a  muddy cold trench day and night shelling cities. See if local Ukrainians  can get into the Russian army camps, perhaps selling vodka, and  persuade the Russians to desert and spend the war doing something more  pleasant and useful than fighting for some old men's lies.

""What  if they gave a war and nobody came?"" -- It really seems possible this  time. The Russian soldiers don't show any desire to fight in this war.  That lack of desire could be a potent weapon of peace, if it is used  right. If Putin's army, or most or a lot of it, simply melts away, what  can he fight the war with?

The  most effective weapon is not that which obliterates the enemy, but the  one that persuades him he never really wanted to fight in the first  place.",1646165741.0

A NoFly-zone means war. 

For what its worth, I doubt it will lead to nuclear war. Its still a very real option, but even if Art 5 is triggered I doubt nuclear war would follow. But there are two things I don't see mentioned. ( Probably because nobody in power is seriously debating if war is an option )

- Normalizing war between nuclear powers could very well lead to more deaths then the entire Ukrainian population over the long run.
- Russian morale is built on denial and ignorance. Those things are brittle. Russians are familiar with the feeling of sudden and complete disillusionment in their government. It has happened before.  Direct NATO involvement gives their morale a solid foundation. Currently, a full war is a risk for Putin's position.

Never used Reddit before so need help to get this message spread.

My idea is that people all over the world use Passport on their tinder account and match with people in Russia, both guys and girls. Once matched we tell them about what is really happening in Ukraine and that they have the power to stop it if they resist their government and take to the streets and protest. Even better is If especially girls can match with soldiers in Ukraine or on the border (the Russian soldiers are probably not allowed to bring their phones when going into Ukraine) 

I guess the goal should be to let young people in Russia know that is going on and to make them understand what future they will face if they don’t protest against their government. 

Below is my idea for a message to send, but there are surely someone here that are better with words. The messages should probably be tailored depending if it’s a guy or a girl etc. 

If we can organize thousands of people to match and send these messages, we will reach millions of people and it will be a personal message to them, not just something they read online. So I believe it will be very powerful! 

Thanks 

To Russia With Love

Does anyone else believe that Russia didn’t come for War per se, but instead came for the Ukrainian children?

I’ve seen reports of the mass deportations of children out of Ukraine and into Russia. It’s almost like, in my eyes. They came in thinking Ukraine would fold but instead they occupied for as long as they could, looted, stole, murdered the parents and buried them in mass graves. 

I don’t doubt the annexing tendencies and that Russia wanted land. It just seems odd to me, that they stole children essentially and then left mass graves.

We can all agree that this war will never end just like the war East of Ukraine never ended unless the root cause of the problem has been solved. China built the great wall of China, and seeing as Ukraine is now the biggest scrap yard in the world, why can Ukranian forces mount an offensive and completely block the borders starting with Belarus, North, then work their way down to the East. I also believe there should be drone strikes on Gomel, Belarus and Russian town. This siege will eternally go on forever unless you stop this tap from leaking or by pushing them back to their own territory.

Arestovich: - With a 99.9% probability, our price for joining NATO is a big war with Russia. And if we do not join NATO, it will be absorbed by Russia within 10-12 years. This is the fork we are in. And now let's choose...  
  
Corr.: And if you put it on the scale, which is better?  
Arestovich: Of course, a major war with Russia and the transition to NATO as a result of the victory over Russia...  
  
Correspondent: And what could it be - a major war with Russia?  
Arestovich: Well, a major offensive air operation, the invasion of Russian armies... four that they created on our border. There... The siege of Kiev, an attempt to encircle the troops who are in the ATO, in the operation of the united forces in the OOS. A breakthrough through the Crimean isthmus, an exit to the Kakhovsky reservoir to give water to the Crimea. The offensive from the territory of Belarus, the creation of new people's republics. Sabotage, attacks on critical infrastructure, and so on. Air landings. That's what a full-fledged war is. And the probability of it is 99%.

Sure, the video evidence shows he's in bad shape, but maybe that parkinson-like shaking and coughing could also be health complications due to him feeling a lot of stress, because stress, and other mental problems can translate to someone's physical health, and the high risk of assasination and his war going south could hurt him for real.

While it's very visible that he is in bad health, I don't think he's gonna drop dead any minute.

I don't think that's the case, this is why:

1. Each decade there were speculations that the tank is dead with each  development of new anti tank weapons, in 60's, 70's, 80's, and yet the tank is still here. It is obvious that there is a race between the tank and the anti tank weapons. The reason why we still have the tank around, is because its defence capabilities were also improved with the years, especially new types of armour were developed to improve its survivability.

2. Not all countries have advanced atgm systems, making the tank still being a very useful tool in some areas of the world with ongoing conflicts. 

3. New anti missile defence systems may be developed in the future. Perhaps a laser system capable to blind and disorient the incoming javelin, or an active system that is capable to shoot down the incoming missile with bullets or other type of projectiles (like the Israeli Trophy system).

4. Also regardless of everything, ruzzians for some reason still have tanks operating in Ukraine. With all the western atgm systems that Ukraine has received, ruzzia still continues to rely on its tanks.... and by the way why is that? I remember Blinken stating that on every ruzzian tank, Ukraine has 10 atgms. If that's the case, how comes ruzzia didn't lose all its tanks by now?

The Many Tragedies of the War in Ukraine,42,xt4nox,RussiaUkraineWar2022,https://www.reddit.com/r/RussiaUkraineWar2022/comments/xt4nox/the_many_tragedies_of_the_war_in_ukraine/,17,"Over 7 months of the war, with no sign of it ending soon, I though it might be a good time to look back and mention some of the tragic facts of this war (I expect corrections on the fine details):

&#x200B;

\-**Ukraine's population:** If the figure of 7 million refugees from the Ukraine is correct (and indeed in my city, I have increasingly heard Russian/Ukrainian outside every time I go out, much more so than a year ago). What does this mean? Not taking into account those that have left for other places outside of the EU, does this mean that within 7 months, the Ukraine has lost 25% of its population at least? And what does that mean for particularly regions near the front lines?

\-**Separation of people and families:** Most of the refugees that have come seem to be females and children, owing to the restrictions on leaving for fighting aged men, who, honourably have stayed to help their country stand its ground and not run away, keeping the standard of duty to one's country in the 21st century.... I do not know what to say to this.

(I have a personal story of a former work colleague that drive all weekend to the Polish border to pick up his family and grandparents when the war started). The EU has done the right thing here, and I do think that most of those from the Ukraine should they decide not to return, will be assets to the countries that have taken them in.

\-**Ukraine's people suffer further economically:** The Ukraine was already considered among the poorest countries in the European continent. Well, heavens knows what this war has done to make a poor situation, a desperate disaster for millions of people who didn't ask for it. Only after the war is over will we know the full extent of this disaster on people's lives

\-**Long term divisions in the Ukraine:** I am surprised we have not heard more of this, but I would find it hard to believe, particularly in the east, that divisions between ethnic Russians and Ukrainians, between perhaps different attitudes towards the Russian invasion may not have permanent ramifications

\-**The obvious death toll:** We won't know the full one until the dust settles.

Being conservative, we are looking at 10s of thousands of civilian casualties

Ukrainian military: Clearly in the 10s of thousands

Russian military (and Donbass Republic forces): We don't know but the lower estimate hints to 25 to 50 thousand casualties?

Are we looking perhaps at around 100 000 deaths so far? (at the very least)

[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2022\_Russian\_invasion\_of\_Ukraine#Casualties](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2022_Russian_invasion_of_Ukraine#Casualties)

Appalling.

My sympathy remains with all those that are there in this situation, who did not choose to be there. Those who are doing what they think is their duty, forced to make decisions I am not called to, from my comfortable chair in front of a keyboard.

\-**War Crimes**: Given claims of war crimes are used as political tools routinely in every war, we won't know all of them and to what extent until the war is over, but there is no doubt they are happening given the scale of people involved in this war.

The killing and abuse of POWs is already documented. The complete destruction of cities like Mariupol happened in front of the world's very eyes. The Russian troops brought in from remote regions such as Chechnya, the harshness of this war based on casualties give reason to believe that human rights (of the civilian population) will take a back seat, regardless of what either side claims. It is obvious that the brunt of these will have been committed by the invader.

**-The reality of a large scale war in Europe in 2022:** It is hard to fathom that there has been a full scale war going on 1 country away. I was aware of the War in Yugoslavia, but that was almost 30 years ago. Now being an adult and having to take this into consideration is a lot. Especially as life still has not been directly affected in anywhere near the same way as events there suggest.

**-Cut-off of Russia from the world community:** Although obviously what the Ukraine is going through is much worse, as mentioned above, the fact remains that we have the largest country in the world, a major country of 140 million people, that has for all intents and purposes disappeared. No flight or rail connections can get you there, interactions with it and its people are essentially blacklisted, their citizens are on the road to being banned from most of the West.

This is not a Middle Eastern rogue state we are talking about, but major member of the world community that seems to have been cancelled and will remain cancelled for the foreseeable future. Unfortunate, even if I personally never was that interested in that part of the world (though bald and bankrupt's vlogs did pique my interest slightly). But I am aware of the large pool of talent from its younger generation, its history and generally have positive recollections with my dealings with Russian people throughout my life (same as with Ukrainians).

We have moved into a much darker, less interconnected world compared to 2019.

**-Revival of old hatreds:** I thought maybe the dislike, suspicion of Russia and Russians might be consigned to the Cold War, kept as a relic in some of the Eastern European countries. Not any more. After already having to be confronted with the anti-Asian feeling during Coronavirus, now the next moral panic came in the form of the war: Anecdotal evidence seems to show a deeper suspicion and reluctance to deal in Russian, promote Russian culture and that any public figure who is of Russian descent needs to go through some sort of loyalty test on politics. Sorry, but I am against all this, and thought the days of putting people under suspicion based on their nationality was behind us, particularly given the drive to refer to any suspicion of Muslims as Islamophobia, right after every terrorist attack.

\-I would mention the **nuclear threat**, however I do not believe either side will take it that far. They haven't before, they won't now. But that this is now talked about again shows we've regressed to the Cold War.

\-**Official abuse of the word ""genocide"":** 2 nations that should know better have abused the term. The Russians, who were fighting a genocidal force in WW2, abused it first by accusing the Ukrainians of it to justify their invasion. Then the Ukrainians, who allied themselves to this genocidal force in WW2 and actively participated in said genocide, reciprocated by using the same language for each war crime. Our leaders in the West have embarrassed themselves by repeating this usage, further cheapening what ""genocide"" actually means for political purposes. All awful.

*Now for us:*

**-Sanctions:** Russia was sanctioned, it retaliated with cutting off the oil pipelines or severely reducing the flow. This of course will have effects on those EU countries most dependent on Russian oil, but also on others through world markets.

Streetlights dim, heating is restricted, public services and transport are cut... we'll see how much further this may go...

**-Hit to world fuel prices for the 3rd world:** people that are already poor face having to eat less. Much worse than what we have to consider here in the EU. All due to Russia and the Ukraine being the world's largest grain exporters, as the ships can't get through or as the fields lie fallow.

**-The hit to living standards in the West, especially in Europe:** We are heading into a long hard winter. High energy prices, inflation, skyrocketing interest rates, shortages and ultimately recession as our economies reach the other side of the cycle. The war in Ukraine, just like the Yom Kippur war and world oil crisis in the 1970s, is just the moment that burst the bubble when the bubble would eventually have burst anyway.

**-Loss of neutrality (national):** Many countries in Europe who previously would have kept a neutral stance have been forced out of it, or have believed the threat is large enough from Russia that this is a topic they cannot sit on the fence on. 

**-Loss of neutrality (media):** As I have written before in a previous post, neutrality of our media on this conflict, and in general, has been thrown into the bin. The hysterical push of one side of the narrative of how we got here simply leads me and probably other free-thinking individuals to distrust what we are told going forward and to look for different views. Blacklisting of any dissenting views on what one would consider as a complex topic, simply via accusing the person of being a Russian troll/bot/agent has laid bare the extent to which we can disagree in our ""democracy"". (Often led by the moral posturing of people that couldn't locate Ukraine on a map, nor could tell the difference between Russians and Ukrainians if their lives depended on it)

Another moral panic, just like we already over the last 2 years. I hate it.

The bias towards certain views was there before, but now it has completely been laid bare.

Are there any maps that speculate on such processes?

This immediately opens up the can of worms of russian nukes. Anyone here has a good listing or authoritative source where major russian nuclear assets are stationed?

UN intervention and occupation at some point, to mop up any scattered WMD's. 

I am very influenced in my thinking by Peter Zeihan. His work on the pecular (clusterfuck) geography of russia was breathtakingly enlightening.

RUSSIANS ARE NOT GUILTY?,124,tvhvct,RussiaUkraineWar2022,https://www.reddit.com/r/RussiaUkraineWar2022/comments/tvhvct/russians_are_not_guilty/,120,"I speak to people and politicians who promote the point that Russian people are not guilty. There are few things that you need to understand about Russians and the Russian Federation.

War is not a choice of only Putin, war is a choice of the vast majority of Russians. According to a survey of independent sociologists 71% of Russians support the war against Ukraine.

When you separate Vladimir Putin from Russians, who vote for Putin, support Putin and support the war, you make a big mistake. Not Putin itself is bombing Ukrainian cities, killing Ukrainian people, rapes women, destroying the future of Ukrainian children, but lots of russians.

Russians say they can't change the regime in the Russian Federation, but they can tear apart the Ukraine. They say ""stop hating russians"", but don't want to stop killing ukranians. Say that Russian people are suffering from sanctions and losing access to the benefits of civilization. At the same time Ukrainian people are suffering from war and losing their lives.

In 2014 when Russian militaries took away part of Ukraine, Crimea, Russians shouted ""Crimea is ours” and praised Putin. Now Russians try to take all of Ukraine. But when the offensive bogged down, they started shouting ""We're not guilty. It was Putin”.

They are not afraid when the Russian Federation commits war crimes, but they are afraid when the Russian Federation commits unsuccessful war crimes.

The Russian Federation considers itself the successor of the Soviet Union and still remains the Evil empire. Russians call smaller countries fraterns to lull their vigilance, and then attack, break, and enslave them. Now they try to do this with Ukraine. But Ukrainians standing strong and desperately resisting a numerically superior enemy.

You need to understand that Russians choose an extensive way of development. They can't create almost anything of their own, so they try to seize goods of other countries like barbarians.

All the reasons they name are fictional and far-fetched. They're inventing new and new reasons during each occupation, such as ""denazification"", ""war against evil west forces"" or ""liberation of russian-speaking people in other countries"".

Russian Federation used similar justifications when attacked Moldova in 1992, Chechnya in 1994, Georgia in 2008, Crimea in 2014, and now the whole Ukraine.

Russians don't believe in crazy fairytales of Russian TV, but they use these crazy fairytales to hide their true motives. Actually, they want to seize as many territories as possible.

You need to understand, Russians are not fooled by propaganda, but they use propaganda to fool you, my friends.

They hear our screams and see our tears, but don't want to stop. Because they have lost their compassion, shame and mercy in irrepressible desire to take away others' goods.

Russia's leaders start wars because the people of Russia like wars. After each military aggression, Putin's rating only increased. You can see that Russians support war with excitement. And this is the true face of Russian culture.

Putin is not the main reason of war. Putin is the consequence of the cult of war that stuck in the minds of most russians.

in 21th century Russian Federation's cult of war is a main threat for the world like the Third Reich's cult of war was a main threat in 20th century. It’s almost impossible to negotiate with those who disrespect international law and human rights.

Therefore, this cult, this system of violence, this evil empire needs to be broken fundamentally as well as the Third Reich was. Otherwise, Russian Federation will regain strength and continue to terrorize people around the world.

You need to understand this to have no illusions and make the right decisions.

The Ukrainians standing strong. But for victory of freedom and our common safety you need not only support Ukraine, but stop supporting Russians until they give up on their cult of war.

The only question is where you will stop them. In front of the home of Ukrainians or in front of your own home.

Bush, with lies and promises the leaders of a country can make the poor or underprivileged fight for them no matter how incompetent they are nor how stupid they are and they can convince their people to stay in a war for twenty years as is the case for us, Putin is much smarter and much more deadly, you need to stop appealing to him or their leaders or their people back home not on the front lines they are too brainwashed and proud, the poor and underprivileged always die for the rich people’s wars which is what their entire army is made up of, starving, and scared, more so of their leaders than you so they will keep going into the meat grinder until they have stripped your country of everything at worst and kill a good portion of you at best.

The Solution:

You want this fight to be over? You walk up en mass armed but weapons holstered and slung and with a white flag to the Russians with every single news camera crew you can find with women and children amongst you, you have your troops and people talk to the Russian troops on camera live, explain we are all just the ones that have to die for the rich who want more at our expense, explain who you are and what you do for a living, talk of your family’s and homes and of your values and traits good and bad, ask them face to face man to man fighter to fighter, do you really want none of us to ever follow our dreams or live past the weeks end when we are all the same just wanting a good life, Stop appealing to the people by video, it’s gotta be face to face, it’s gotta be real and tangible, bring them food, bring them anything but booze, appeal to their humanity, not their leaders and we have the only real hope of normality again, show each other your not the monster the leaders pretend, it is a huge risk but I think it’s a calculated one, if they open fire, it will be broadcast live around the world, so either they would leave or at minimum it would get them talking to each other about leaving or the whole world would watch you being killed together men, women, children and news crews from every country and the world would be forced to act and send in troops and your country will be free, either way more of your men and women and Children will die but this would have more of a chance at ending the war than a bullet ever will.

Putin's threat of nuclear war if Finland and Sweden join NATO,26,u45n2p,RussiaUkraineWar2022,https://www.reddit.com/r/RussiaUkraineWar2022/comments/u45n2p/putins_threat_of_nuclear_war_if_finland_and/,33,"I was looking into what kind of counter measures there were (not at all hopeful now lol) and what a nuclear war would look like between Russia and NATO and this paragraph really stood out given its citing Putin from January this year ;  
    
"" It was this shared understanding of the consequences of nuclear Armageddon that led to the 1985 statement by then US President Ronald Reagan and Soviet General Secretary Mikhail Gorbachev that “a nuclear war cannot be won and must never be fought.” This statement [**was reaffirmed**](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2022/01/03/p5-statement-on-preventing-nuclear-war-and-avoiding-arms-races/) by Presidents Biden and Putin as recently as January 2022. Even as war rages in Ukraine it remains as true now as it was then. ""  


It makes me wonder, seeing as these missiles require more than just one person (namely Putin) to launch them, if his generals and staff would remind him of this statement both him AND Biden agreed on and reaffirmed just months ago, or if they would willing be culpable to such a destructive and pointless incident. That is of course, if he's not just blowing smoke out of his ass with these threats regarding Finland and Sweden.

Difference Between Misinformation and Opinion,12,tty1wn,RussiaUkraineWar2022,https://www.reddit.com/r/RussiaUkraineWar2022/comments/tty1wn/difference_between_misinformation_and_opinion/,22,"A lot of posts (Russian agents or brainwashed people) on here claim to be unable to express an ""opinion"" about Ukraine (ie their relationship with Azov) without having their content blocked.

Think we should clarify something.

Misinformation and opinions are two different things.

If you're saying Ukraine's Jewish President is bombing civilians and encouraging the neo-nazi Azov regime to kill civilians, you're spreading misinformation to the extreme. Nazis in Ukraine hate Zelenskyy and all other liberal politicans. [https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/ukraine-soldiers-chechnya-killings/](https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/ukraine-soldiers-chechnya-killings/)

If you're saying Ukraine's government's temporary alliance with Azov, who are known to be a far right and violent group, is problematic, we can have a conversation. That's an opinion. And it can be nuanced and take into account the current desperation of the Ukrainian people, while also acknowledging the fascist history of this very small and drastically unpopular group in Ukraine.

""In a face-to-face confrontation with militants from the neo-Nazi Azov Battalion who had launched a campaign to sabotage the peace initiative called “No to Capitulation,” Zelensky encountered a wall of obstinacy. 

With appeals for disengagement from the frontlines firmly rejected, Zelensky [**melted down**](https://www.kyivpost.com/ukraine-politics/im-not-a-loser-zelensky-clashes-with-veterans-over-donbas-disengagement.html?__cf_chl_tk=SbolmTBS6QnjMnPJLiQEsivGNnuW6T4od28tzMOrEM0-1646110945-0-gaNycGzNCJE) on camera. “I’m the president of this country.

Why Freedom and Free Ukrainian’s will Prevail in the War with Russia,18,tstdb4,RussiaUkraineWar2022,https://www.reddit.com/r/RussiaUkraineWar2022/comments/tstdb4/why_freedom_and_free_ukrainians_will_prevail_in/,6,"On January 20, 1981 the late and great President Ronald Reagan said:

“Above all, we must realize that no arsenal or no weapon in the arsenals of the world is so formidable as the will and moral courage of free men and women. It is a weapon our adversaries in today's world do not have. It is a weapon that we as Americans do have. Let that be understood by those who practice terrorism and prey upon their neighbors.

He went on further to say:

“Martin Treptow, left his job in a small town barbershop in 1917 to go to France in World War One with the famed Rainbow Division. There, on the western front, he was killed trying to carry a message between battalions under heavy artillery fire.

We're told that on his body was found a diary. On the flyleaf under the heading, ``My Pledge,'' he had written these words: 

“America must win this war. Therefore I will work, I will save, I will sacrifice, I will endure, I will fight cheerfully and do my utmost, as if the issue of the whole struggle depended on me alone.''


The Ukrainian people are making the sacrifices that Martin Treptow and so many others were called upon to make to defend freedom.  The hearts , minds , and spirit of the Ukrainian people is on display to the entire world and their unwavering resolve to defend freedom, their country, and way of life. The Russian invaders can bomb their cities, and perform crimes against humanity, but they will never kill freedom or conquer the spirit, humanity, and resolve   of the Ukrainian people to remain free.

American psychiatrist diagnosed Putin,34,w4a68i,RussiaUkraineWar2022,https://www.reddit.com/r/RussiaUkraineWar2022/comments/w4a68i/american_psychiatrist_diagnosed_putin/,28,"  James Fallon believes that the President of the Russian Federation is very dangerous, and in conditions when he is in danger of losing everything, he will be able to use nuclear weapons.

James Fallon has been closely following Vladimir Putin’s actions for several years in order to recreate the course of his thoughts on the decisions made, writes The insider. Psychiatrist, professor at the University of California Fallon specializes in psychopathic personality disorders. To make sure the diagnosis was correct, he spoke with the leaders of Ukraine, representatives of the leadership of Russia, Chechnya, Belarus and Germany, and also read everything he could find about the upbringing and formation of the Russian dictator.

“You can’t just see someone on TV and say ‘this is a psychopath’,” the psychiatrist emphasizes. “But, in my opinion, Putin did have important prerequisites for the development of the so-called cluster B personality disorders – the most dangerous ones, including psychopathy and narcissistic disorder personality”.

**What is psychopathy?**

To describe this disorder, Fallon uses the definition proposed by the American psychiatrist Hervey Cleckley. In 1941, in The Mask of Sanity, he described the psychopath as a person who appears normal and does everything to maintain this illusion. However, all psychopaths are distinguished by low emotional empathy. All of them are manipulators, selfish and aggressors who cannot feel pity, remorse or guilt. At the same time, they are callous and put themselves above all. 

The psychiatrist notes that psychopaths are divided into primary and secondary. In the former, the development of pathology is due to a process called “epigenetic marking” and manifests itself already in the first years of life. Due to trauma and exposure to stress hormones, the regulation of key genes changes almost irreversibly, this affects hormones in the frontal and temporal lobes of the brain.

Changes in the psyche of secondary psychopaths, also called sociopaths, are caused by emotional, physical, sexual abuse or bullying, and are partly reversible.

The behavior of psychopaths of both types is very different: a sociopath knows that he is acting immorally, but cannot stop, a psychopath is sure that he is doing the right thing, believing that he is right.

“This is an integral trait of the personality of a true primary psychopath: he never doubts that he is doing the right thing,” says James Fallon. Putin”.

**What provokes the aggression of a psychopath?**

The psychiatrist emphasizes that psychopaths are always looking for weakness in their victims, it is she who provokes them. Not being able to experience emotions, they are able to read them, they are well versed in other people’s feelings, fears, triggers and desires. With this knowledge, psychopaths manipulate their victims into getting the desired reaction, money, sex, or simply reveling in a sense of control.

“Putin’s key method is to keep his opponents from getting stronger, to strike at their weakest moment,” Fallon notes. “Self-disciplined psychopaths have the patience to wait months, years, even 10 years, until their victim shows vulnerability.”

In addition to this, the Russian dictator can be attributed to malignant narcissists, and the features of a sadist also appear in him. “It just doesn’t get worse,” says the psychiatrist.

In his opinion, several traumas made Putin so: a difficult childhood, and then the collapse of the USSR, which led to the creation of an independent Ukraine. Hitler experienced something similar in his youth. In 2011, Putin saw Libyan dictator Gaddafi die in agony, cementing a deep fear of violent regime change.

“All the implicit has been revealed in the last few years, and especially brightly in the last few weeks until February 24,” notes James Fallon. “Putin, like Hitler, revealed his true nature, and it became clear that he was acting precisely as a psychopath, and not a sociopath and certainly not like a normal person with bad tendencies.”

The psychiatrist is sure that Vladimir Putin’s behavior shows signs of clouding his mind: from pompous narcissism, he moved on to paranoia and hostile unbalanced behavior. Probably degenerative processes are going on in his brain.

## What to expect from Putin?

Vladimir Putin used to be calm, cold and prudent in public, but now it is more difficult for him to control himself, this indicates that he is extremely dangerous. It is difficult to predict his decisions, as the Russian president is losing his adequacy.

Rebuffed in Ukraine, he may feel stumped, Fallon said. When confronted with resistance, psychopaths and aggressors get lost and may even take flight, but Putin has nowhere to run. Now he has stopped hiding his feelings and this makes him even more dangerous, since it is no longer necessary to maintain the image of a cold-blooded person.

Psychopaths are distinguished by the fact that they are ready to do anything to achieve the goal. Achieving his own, Putin willingly commits war crimes, and he is one step away from using tactical nuclear weapons.

“People with psychopathy can take a lot, but as soon as the stress becomes too strong or prolonged, if they end up cornered, they lose control of themselves,” the psychiatrist emphasizes. “It is impossible to predict when Putin will be at this point. But when it comes, he will either run away or want to tear everything down and go all the way.. It only seems like irrational behavior, but in reality he is just testing the limits, drop by drop, like any bully testing someone for weakness. Say, let’s try , but if it doesn’t work out, we will step back and say: “Oh no, all we wanted was the Donbass.”

## How to neutralize Putin?

Putin is a clear primary charismatic psychopath who does not intend to openly show anger. Such predators retreat. when they get a rebuff. But if you corner them, they will start to defend themselves in all available ways, says James Fallon.

In his opinion, the best tactic for dealing with psychopaths is gradual and constant pressure on Putin without sudden movements, so as not to provoke a nuclear war. Under these conditions, sooner or later he will definitely make a mistake.

“Now taking drastic, drastic measures is not the best way out,” the psychiatrist is sure.

Fallon believes that Putin is waiting for a misguided move from Ukraine that, in the eyes of most Russians, will give him the right to any response. To do this, he needs a massive strike from Ukraine on a Russian settlement, or some larger target.

At the same time, it is clear that Putin cannot win this war: the more support Ukraine receives, the weaker the support of the dictator himself in his entourage. In the end, one of the Russian generals will be able to tell him that it is impossible to do this. However, according to the psychiatrist, this will require another months of struggle.

“Based on my knowledge of military psychology, I think it’s worth showing Putin that the West will stop at nothing,” says Fallon. point where we can wipe you off the face of the earth. We don’t want to do it, but we can.”

Recall that earlier Dr. Kenneth Dekleva says Putin is in an “echo chamber”where he does not hear other opinions.

RUSSIANS ARE NOT GUILTY?,16,tvhk87,RussiaUkraineWar2022,https://www.reddit.com/r/RussiaUkraineWar2022/comments/tvhk87/russians_are_not_guilty/,25," 

I speak to people and politicians who promote the point that Russian people are not guilty. There are few things that you need to understand about Russians and the Russian Federation.

War is not a choice of only Putin, war is a choice of the vast majority of Russians. According to a survey of independent sociologists 71% of Russians support the war against Ukraine.

When you separate Vladimir Putin from Russians, who vote for Putin, support Putin and support the war, you make a big mistake. Not Putin itself is bombing Ukrainian cities, killing Ukrainian people, rapes women, destroying the future of Ukrainian children, but lots of russians.

Russians say they can't change the regime in the Russian Federation, but they can tear apart the Ukraine. They say ""stop hating russians"", but don't want to stop killing ukranians. Say that Russian people are suffering from sanctions and losing access to the benefits of civilization. At the same time Ukrainian people are suffering from war and losing their lives.

In 2014 when Russian militaries took away part of Ukraine, Crimea, Russians shouted ""Crimea is ours” and praised Putin. Now Russians try to take all of Ukraine. But when the offensive bogged down, they started shouting ""We're not guilty. It was Putin”. 

They are not afraid when the Russian Federation commits war crimes, but they are afraid when the Russian Federation commits unsuccessful war crimes.

The Russian Federation considers itself the successor of the Soviet Union and still remains the Evil empire. Russians call smaller countries fraterns to lull their vigilance, and then attack, break, and enslave them. Now they try to do this with Ukraine. But Ukrainians standing strong and desperately resisting a numerically superior enemy.

You need to understand that Russians choose an extensive way of development. They can't create almost anything of their own, so they try to seize goods of other countries like barbarians.

All the reasons they name are fictional and far-fetched. They're inventing new and new reasons during each occupation, such as ""denazification"", ""war against evil west forces"" or ""liberation of russian-speaking people in other countries"".

Russian Federation used similar justifications when attacked Moldova in 1992, Chechnya in 1994, Georgia in 2008, Crimea in 2014, and now the whole Ukraine.

Russians don't believe in crazy fairytales of Russian TV, but they use these crazy fairytales to hide their true motives. Actually, they want to seize as many territories as possible. 

You need to understand, Russians are not fooled by propaganda, but they use propaganda to fool you, my friends.

They hear our screams and see our tears, but don't want to stop. Because they have lost their compassion, shame and mercy in irrepressible desire to take away others' goods.

Russia's leaders start wars because the people of Russia like wars. After each military aggression, Putin's rating only increased. You can see that Russians support war with excitement. And this is the true face of Russian culture.

Putin is not the main reason of war. Putin is the consequence of the cult of war that stuck in the minds of most russians. 

in 21th century Russian Federation's cult of war is a main threat for the world like the Third Reich's cult of war was a main threat in 20th century. It’s almost impossible  to negotiate with those who disrespect international law and human rights.

Therefore, this cult, this system of violence, this evil empire needs to be broken fundamentally as well as the Third Reich was. Otherwise, Russian Federation will regain strength and continue to terrorize people around the world.

You need to understand this to have no illusions and make the right decisions.

The Ukrainians standing strong. But for victory of freedom and our common safety you need not only support Ukraine, but stop supporting Russians until they give up on their cult of war.

The only question is where you will stop them. In front of the home of Ukrainians or in front of your own home.",1649014192.0

Mobilization + Referendum = Putin stops this war?,43,xnfiq9,RussiaUkraineWar2022,https://www.reddit.com/r/RussiaUkraineWar2022/comments/xnfiq9/mobilization_referendum_putin_stops_this_war/,53,"A few days ago, Russia announced a military mobilization. Some sources say that the total amount of conscriptions is planned to be 1.2 million in three waves with the first wave of about 300k conscriptions.
The final mobilization date for the last wave is claimed to be December 1st. That probably means that every wave will have about 2 weeks of training before going to the frontline. Such amount of training is pretty silly for actual fighting in modern war. 

Does Russia plan to start a massive offensive and seize all Ukraine's territory? The major problem here is that the offensive requires a lot of heavy weapons, and Russians don't seem to have too much of them. They've already lost up to 30% of their weapons and there are no visible sources for the new weapons. Even the guns they equip their new conscriptions with seem to be a piece of rusty junk.
So there is no much hope for a successful offensive. Any attempts for it with large amounts of the untrained manpower and armor deficiency are doomed to huge losses of ex-civilians, and hence internal political instability.

Same time Russia launched the voting on the occupied territories and plans to annex them as the result. The problem with that referendum (even being a fake one) is that it establishes the borders of the annexed territory. If Putin plans the further offensive, why would he outline the exact borders?

My idea is that Putin understood pretty clearly that he is stuck in Ukraine and no advances are possible. But the territory he already occupied is now under the risk of being lost to the AFU. So he conducts the mobilization to put his untrained soldiers deep into the trenches to hold the current line.

Will Ukraine be able to break this frontline? Well, they will need a lot of tanks and aviation to do that. Which they lack.
Ukraine has much less tanks and jets than Russia, and there are no announced deliveries of them from the NATO countries.

So Biden has a decision to make now. And that decision is: will he accept Putin's offer to stop the war? Otherwise, it's the USA's turn to escalate with Abrams M1. No Abrams' means Putin has actually stopped the war.",1664087115.0

I’ve seen people comment all throughout social media that it’s essentially her fault and she deserves what’s coming to her since she broke Russian laws. 

But has no one considered that Russia is literally truthful about nothing and there’s no externally validated proof that she did anything that they’re claiming she did? 

I mean, she’s been traveling to and from Russia to play basketball for a considerable amount of time and it would be fair to assume she knows the country’s laws by now. 

I firmly believe she’s being used a political pawn and Russia is making an example out of her but I don’t understand the uproar and apprehension to fight for her to be swapped. I wholeheartedly understand that, yes, there are other US citizens imprisoned there, but she was arrested RIGHT towards the beginning of the war (which adds more to my political pawn theories), but despite being famous, she’s still a person. And one that posses traits that Russia does not have a history of being accepting of (homosexuality, race etc.).

With that being said, I’m just curious on other view points of why this situation is being taken at face value. Why are Americans believing everything Russia says without question?

Just stop everything you are doing and protest! If some gets thrown in jail or disappear, continue!! Be nice to the police and military, invite them to join you! The more people who does not work, are thrown in jail or tells their story, the more will join. If the protests gets massive, the military has to step in, and this will probably ease the killings in Ukraine.

Sure, Putin will get desperate and probably stage a counter/terrorist attack on Russians to try to change the opinion, ignore it and continue the protests. No one in Ukraine or Europe are after your blood.

Russia have said that they would only use Nukes to protect their sovereignty. 

Some recent videos have shown gas/oilworks being attacked by drones and the like on Russias own soil. 

Not only does this bring into mind the questionable abilities of their defence, but also the concern that attacks on civil sides of Russia could quickly lead a more radical retaliation as they declare it as “terrorism”. 

It’s unfathomable how they can proceed with the “special military operation” and directly/indirectly affect and damage civilians life’s, but the second it happens to them it’s “terrorism”. Squeaky clean Russia would never allow themselves to show as hypocrites would they!!

I don’t believe they would jump to nukes over such things, moreso step up the use of rockets on more civilian bases areas which are not current main targets for Russia. But at what point do strikes on their own land fall under a threat to their sovereignty?",1655994893.0

Thing is, we will get drug into it. Then we will once again have sat by why so many civilians were killed and suffering. WWII started in what 1938 and we didn’t enter until 1941 ffs. Another situation when we were being begged for help. 

I don’t want a war, but letting a dictator invade a democracy in Europe isn’t something that happens every day. I am glad we are finally sending drones. We should’ve done that long ago. Same with anti-aircraft systems that can reach high altitudes.

But even the treatment that American veterans recieved was positively luxurious compared to the treatment that Australian Vietnam veterans recieved in their homeland (many Veterans clubs in Australia didn't and still don't allow Vietnam veterans in, due to the war's unpopularity and due to war crimes commited by the troops).

With both leaders meeting and asking Putin to wait until the Olympics are over, has had the entire focus of the West switch to be on Russia and not on China. It's also been seen in China that they promote this ""Anti-Ukraine"" ideology like in Russia, and there's been barely/no news of China interfering with the war. Whether both leaders knew how outdated Russia was, or how poorly Russia would actually do, and Putin's poor communication/paranoia is where my theory starts to slip. Along whether poorly supplying the soldiers with outdated supplies and weapons was intentional to prolong the war. AND if it's true that some medias propose the war will last years, imagine how much can be done for years being ""unsupervised"" by the government/media.

And whichever being the case, its a lose/lose for the West, as if they refocus their attention on China, Russia will prodominantly claim Ukraine, and however keeping their attention on Russia means China's been doing a load of shady behind-the-scenes that they could be secretly preparing for a Taiwan invasion since the media isn't on them.

• Moscow has demanded that European buyers pay for gas in rubles, depositing euros into Gazprombank account, which are then converted into rubles by Russia’s central bank.

• Poland and Bulgaria are relatively dependent on Russian gas imports. However, both countries will be able to find alternatives in the short-term, as long as Russia does not cut off all gas supplies to the EU.

• It is unclear whether the payment method demanded by Russia violates EU sanctions. Buyers in Italy and Germany plan to make payments in euros later this month.
