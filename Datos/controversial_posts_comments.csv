It's funny listening to this retard, all he done was describe what will happen to them ""what goes around..."" what a fuck puppet he is lol",u5o56g
How is he still alive,u5o56g

What a fking brain washed traitor.,u5o56g
"Lovely to see this gentleman nice and safe in Meriupol, unlike the 20,000 who have died at the hands of the Russian invaders and those who have been injured and starved by Russians. His fellow Russians who have been blocking evacuation of and humanitarian aid to the civilians, whilst also targeting civilians, looting and raping and forcibly deporting civilians‚Ä¶ all being war crimes on their own, but collectively and command driven they are genocidal acts. 

This man is wrong on so many things and is merely acting as a mouthpiece for the Russians who probably think his moderate grasp of English and his American twang give him some credibility and authenticity.  Frankly he just comes across as an outright wanker!  

Anyway, I could list where he‚Äôs wrong but it‚Äôd take me a couple of hours and I don‚Äôt think he would take any notice. So, I urge him to examine the facts and use his brain. If not, I urge him to pick up a rifle and then he can receive battlefield justice for his encouragement of genocide.",u5o56g

"I think he's more useful alive.

The more Americans see of him, the more they'll start to draw analogies with Jane Fonda, Lord Haw Haw and Tokyo Rose. They'll start to realise that the Russians mean harm to everyone. They want to change the way people just like you and me live their lives.

The best possible outcome would be twinning his videos with quotes from the guys who saw Fascism for what it is. Guys like Churchill and Orwell, like Abe Lincoln and Patton.",u5o56g

That SOB would launch missiles at Europe and say we launched first and use 1950's video to back his claim.,twztp8
Because rational minds have so far prevailed.  I hope it stays that way.,twztp8
Because Putin repeatedly threatened to nuke anyone who did.,twztp8
"Yes, why didnt the west start World War 3 and get everyone killed.",twztp8
because we aint tryna start WW3,twztp8
So why don't you go and fight?,twztp8
Coz nukes. It'll start an all out nuclear war.. Millions of innocent deaths.,twztp8
You know damn well why.,twztp8
This is such a stupid post,twztp8
US needs to draw the line in the sand.  Putin must end!,twztp8
"I agree with you 100%.  When Germany and the Soviet Union invaded Poland on 31st August 1939, the United Kingdom and France joined the fight on September 3rd.

I seriously have no idea why nobody is helping, or at least trying to play an offense on Russian territory.

Yes, WW3 will land, but isn't it already here. A facist, a nazi has started a war again, a war that echos the one in WW2.  Should we not stop him now to stop further destruction?   On the other hand, do we want to play with the what if he fires nuclear weapons.

&#x200B;

No win situation.",twztp8
"why is this war any different than the countless other global conflicts where the west has ‚Äúdone nothing‚Äù ? , innocent people die around the world from war and genocide every single day.  your heart might be in the right place but it sounds like you need to grow up a bit.",twztp8
"Believe it or not, the West is saving lives.  
Yes, it sucks...it really sucks. I hate this aspect of this war but the death of hundreds of thousands may have been averted...so far.",twztp8
"I'm not agreeing or disagreeing with the OP though the edited comments at the bottom of the initial post does seem significant. In some alternate timeline if Russia invaded Alaska because they just love Sarah Palin so much they want to kidnap her and bring her back to Ruskie land, the United States wouldn't think twice to commiting our entire military apparatus into throwing back the invasion and pushing to remove military targets inside Russia capable of ever committing to such an act again. 

It's two different things, Ukraine and this make believe scenario, but the relevance of us not concerning ourselves with a possible nuclear strike is the same. Our current policy on the defense of Taiwan against a nuclear armed China is the same concept. 


Like I said not agreeing or disagreeing ... Just an interesting thought.",twztp8
"WITH NO INTENT to insult the poster, it constantly amazes me how ignorant people are about how to start a major war. ""Ignorant,"" I say, lacking knowledge not stupid.  IF the USA goes into Ukraine with any troops and makes contact with Russian troops it will create a  big war that will make what is happening in Ukraine small stuff. Unlike many, I do not believe such a war would be a ""world"" war because it would be between Russia and the NATO countries only. China would sit back with the popcorn and watch and dread any nuclear fallout. Same with all the countries of Asia, Africa and South America. There would be a lot of ""not my fucking problem"" with many countries. There would be enough fallout from any nukes fired between NATO and Russia to fuck-up the world without anyone else piling on. NO the USA cannot be the world cop anymore. Send money and arms? Sure. BUT NO CONTACT! Same with all NATO countries. The Russians know the Western limits so crazy Vlad and his butchers can do mass murder, grin and say, ""Oh yeah? I DARE you to DO something about it!"" More T-72s and other more lethal BIG weapons, please.",twztp8
"The West should supply them with whatever offensive weapon's they need to drive these Russian scum from the Ukraine..  Deny doing it, just like Russia does...Quit treating them like they are some great military power.. Keep Putin guessing what the west might do next.. Two can play that game",twztp8
"We turn a blind eye to atrocities like this all the time.

Two examples off the top of my head:
The taliban just regained control and Palestine is a mess.
It‚Äôs horrible what‚Äôs happening in the world, but until all of our countries stop electing stupid gutless blind leaders this world will never change.",twztp8
Because the west has nothing to gain putting their troops in a conflict they created but pushing nato eastward,twztp8
Coming soon to a theater near you. WW3. And not a moment too soon. Neuter Putin ASAP.,twztp8
"I‚Äôd rather not die in a nuclear Holocaust, thank you",twztp8
"Again, one word, nukes.",twztp8
"Because 1 out of every 2 nuclear weapons on the planet are Russian. No one is dumb enough to escalate hostilities to a point where nuclear exchange becomes a possibility, and the SECOND Russia feels threatened by a massive counter-invasion they would do everything in their power to stop it. They would absolutely use nukes to prevent a NATO invasion, and the US or any other nuclear power would absolutely do the same.",twztp8
fuck all of you pussies scared of putins nukes how can you sleep when babies are tortured and murdered for nothing fuck this kind of world then,twztp8
"Time to impose a no fly zone over Ukraine. Yes it will result in direct combat with the Russia and NATO but I it won't start WW3. Putin has said that the use of nukes will only occur if there is an existential threat to Russia. As long as NATO doesn't cross the border with Russia, then this threat doesn't exist. Beating back the Russians and chasing them back home isn't a threat to Russia's existence. If the West does not do this, then the slaughter of thousands will be a stain on our ideals and the basis of democracy. China will see this weakness and expand their own military options into Taiwan, Northern India and the Spratly Islands in the South China Sea. They will only have to threaten the use of nukes to get the US and it's allies to back off and allow the expansion of China. 

Lastly I believe that the Russians love their children as much as any other country. I don't see them willing to sacrifice their children in a nuclear exchange over a piece of real estate that does nothing to protect their country.",twztp8
"Because our leaders are more reasonable.

  
When I saw the pictures from Bucha, my first thought was: Send the Russians a couple of Tomahawk cruise missiles with 100kt nuclear warheads and nuke the shit out of their depoyment areas.",twztp8
So many naive people giving there opinions on what we should do in a war.  99% of you have never even shot a gun.,twztp8
"Isn't it fascinating just how quickly the mentality has shifted, and now people are wanting the US to be the world police again.",twztp8
two overriding factors are Fear and Money.,twztp8
I truly don't understand the West ...they should be ashamed of themselves...,twztp8
">Finally, why did our governments in the West not go in and meet Russia's army in Ukraine?

What part of nuclear weapons don't you understand?",twztp8
they are trying to avoid WW3,twztp8
"It‚Äôs time to go in.  We need a coalition of countries that are willing to go in as peacekeepers, at the very least, and create corridors.  Of course, this means fighting Russia because they will inevitably attack those corridors.  And before anyone replies about WW3, we are already in WW3.  And before the nuclear response, we have no idea when and if Putin is going to use nuclear weapons, however it is completely unethical to allow war crimes to continue.",twztp8
"I think it's pretty clear the West is helping. Now going to war is an existential threat level decision. As sad as it is, empathy has nothing to do with it.",twztp8
cmon poland to the funni,twztp8
"If Putin is terminally ill, the risk is his mental state will be harder to predict. In the UK, you get refused a gun license for example if you have terminal cancer because you are a suicide risk. This would be a huge gamble for Nato. It is also unlikely that Nato would get the agreement of all members since there are those more at risk from immediate Russian retaliation than others. We only have to look at rhe Germans and other European countries still buying Russian gas to realise that the question is a complicated one. What's happening in Ukraine is awful but WW3 would extrapolate that suffering all over Europe and perhaps globally. If for example Nato got involved, that might bring China in. Then there's the Pacific alliance which could invokve many nations in Asia. Which side would India be on? Israel? History shows us that when big alliances get involved in war, a domino effect sees that war spread. We saw it with WW1 and WW2. Difference then was that such wars, after gargantuan efforts and losses in blood and treasure, could be won. Nobody wins WW3.",twztp8
I think it‚Äôs to limit steps to another world war. Things could escalate fast and people are scared of nuclear war. Not because the west doesn‚Äôt care.,twztp8
"The truth is that America is sick of war. NATO is sick of following America into wars. A loss in Ukraine with subsequent guerrilla warfare and a prolonged presence of Russian forces in that country hurts Russia more. Besides, Ukrainian people are looked down upon by some sectors of Russia. 

They have whipped sentiment in Russia to a frenzy, and they will accept nothing less than total annihilation of Ukrainian forces, complete extermination of the people, and annexation of their territory. Why is Russia unable to do that? A few missiles from NATO? Really? Putin has put himself in a difficult situation, because a loss to Ukraine, albeit armed by NATO, will be seen *much* worse than a loss to actual NATO forces. This would be a national humiliation. A negotiated ""win"" where they do not kill or topple Zelenskyy, they do not dismantle the Ukrainian army, and do not get to keep invaded territories, will *also* be perceived as a loss.",twztp8
"Not to downplay the atrocities the orcs are committing in Ukraine but this is nowhere near Nanjing levels, tens of thousands were killed, raped, and tortured. Sad fact is we are looking at most a few hundred in Bucha. The war as a whole a few thousand. Two million people died in the aftermath of our invasion of Iraq (allegedly). Nuclear war would kill billions, in a matter of minutes.",twztp8
We are not the world police,twztp8
"Put aside that NATO is a defensive deterrent that Ukraine isn‚Äôt a part of, and even setting aside the likelihood that nukes are brought into play in the event of conflict with Russia, the answer is this - you‚Äôre exposing a lot more people to war. 

The things you‚Äôre seeing in Ukraine are fucking terrible, but should NATO intervene you‚Äôre going to see it spread to Poland, the Baltics, Romania, etc. Yes, Russia is getting smacked in the mouth in Ukraine, but it‚Äôs hubris to underestimate what their capable of. Not to mention cities in those border countries are in range of artillery and missile fire, so Russia could theoretically sit back and target civilian populations from their home turf. War would spread and more people will die in bad ways, it‚Äôs plain and simple.

Secondly, we all tend to be keyboard warriors here but would you fight? If shit hit the fan, everyone shitting on NATO for not stepping in would very likely not be the ones to fight in that war. Other people would, and that is also lives potentially lost. A larger war simply makes everything worse. 

Could the EU and NATO be doing more to help Ukraine? Fuck yea, I‚Äôd say so. Too reliant on Russia natural gas, too many people believing and supporting that Russian propaganda, etc. But there‚Äôs a cost to everything, and thankfully it does seem like those costs are being calculated and not just throwing caution to the wind. It‚Äôs shit what‚Äôs happening in Ukraine, but it can get worse. Pushing for a larger war ensures that.",twztp8
No NATO involved country can do anything on its own without dragging all other countries in NATO into the war.,twztp8
"It‚Äôs easy to say that the West should do this or that while sitting behind the safety of your computer screen but if the West did intervene, what would you do? You would likely continue to sit comfortably behind your screen and carry on about your day while other people fight. 

One of your two arguments, both of which are poor and you aren‚Äôt helping your case by repeating that same thing like a bot or parrot, about seeing someone threaten your neighbor with a gun is kinda useless because you won‚Äôt be doing anything, would will let somebody else do something for you. By you not taking physical action, you are just as complicit as the rest of the world that hasn‚Äôt taken physical action. 

And what about the families of those Westerner soldiers that do go to fight? What will you tell them when their son and daughters, brothers and sisters, moms and dads start to come back dead? Would you sit there comfortably with your life still intact and tell them the Old Lie of ‚ÄúDulce et decorum est Pro patria mori.‚Äù?

I‚Äôd like to help and for action to be taken as much as anyone but the world is a complicated place and things don‚Äôt always go the way we want.",twztp8
This topic makes me grateful of how cool headed an professional the Western leaders are.,twztp8
Because full scale world war dumbass,twztp8
"Because Ukraine is not part of NATO and being officially active in a war against Russia is something we try to avoid at all costs. Also, the West has supported Ukraine significantly on top of the Millions of dollars worth of weaponry the US alone has been supplying and sending, we're also supporting humanitarian aid on a massive scale...Also, thousands of citizens from the West are currently in Ukraine and Poland volunteering their time, skills, and risking their lives. The West has not abandoned Ukraine. We continue to support them more and more each day... We have been actively helping since BEFORE Russia actually invaded. This is why Russia has a big propaganda campaign out on the West right now, Put-Put wants us to back off but we aren't going to do that. 

Russians are now spewing a bunch of junk about invading Poland. Poland is apparently also their enemy now and Putin says it should also be part of Russia....  If that happens, we WILL be going to war as Poland is part of NATO....But we do not want this to happen. Even though we would annihilate Russia, it would still come with great costs. Nuclear weapons would be involved and many, many more would die. Air and earth would be poisoned...it would be a big deal. 

So, I completely understand your frustration and disgust. It is appalling and I want to see Putin pay for it too... But right now that anger needs to be directed at Russia and their supporters (looking at you, China).",twztp8
Nukes is the reason.,twztp8
Because then he‚Äôll just nuke Ukraine and be like ‚Äúthis is your fault‚Äù,twztp8
"Not playing this down but it‚Äôs amazing how short our collective memory is. The only thing different about this war is social media. The fucked up thing is this isn‚Äôt even a fraction of what has happened in previous wars, we just see all the gory details now. I‚Äôm not sure our world leaders are in a hurry to have a nuclear holocaust over Ukraine and I‚Äôm with them on that. It‚Äôs sad but they will have to slug it out with western equipment and their own soldiers.",twztp8
"As horrible as it is, the reason is obvious. Even if there's a 10% chance or 1% chance it turns nuclear, we're all fucking dead. So yeah, makes sense why the west hasn't entered into the arena. How more obvious could this be? Putin is a madman, this is a chance I would not take.",twztp8
This kind of murder has been going on in other countries for decades. No one cared. Yemen has had war for a while now. No one cares. Any of you complaining are more than welcome to go over there and fight.,twztp8
"I totally agree. I live in the west and I have been waiting for our government to step in and stop this. It is better to stand up to a bully then to sit back and just watch what happens. Where is our backbone?
I think the United States are afraid of a nuclear war and millions die. But we also can‚Äôt sit back and let them swallow up smaller European countries either. If it were me I would put American boots in Ukraine. This needs to stop and Putin needs to pay.",twztp8
"To be fair, I think this is most peoples‚Äô initial, emotional reaction, then after a few moments they realize it would be a bad idea for all the reasons listed so far.",twztp8
"Whats wrong with  some here telling about nuke war...,. Man you are not normal in your Head.  This type  od  war has maybe  max. 5 % chanse to hapen...,. Russians are testing EU and USA how far can they go. And it seams that EU and USA cant have  enougt influence  on their economy cause India and China cover Russians back",twztp8
"Sickened by posts exactly like this, remind OP nuclear deterrents are a thing.",twztp8
"I don't think you'll find the answers to these questions on Reddit. Russians are shit-people, pretty much always have been. There's a legion of foreign volunteers helping fight for Ukraine if you want to help. If you are not aware of the geopolitical complexities at this point, I can't help you. Short answer is ideals get wonky when nuclear weapons are in play.",twztp8
I believe that he knows he is terminally ill. A spiritually deprived narcissist that is about to die‚Ä¶ what incentive does he have not to launch his nukes?,twztp8
"This dude is a bot, he keeps copying and pasting his replies, and I‚Äôve seen the exact same shit under other user names as well.",twztp8
"I'm finding it impossible to not feel guilty 
about us and other NATO countries standing by and doing nothing physically to help these people protect themselves. This is shameful on such a large scale in this day and age. So what if Russia threatens us !  We need to pick our balls up and do what is needed to stop this carnage. Shame on Biden.....",twztp8
"If West, let's say Canada, actively engages with Russia, Russia ain't gonna sit idle. Putin is going to respond with equal if not more destructive military force. Canada, like most western states , is a members of NATO - an attack on one member is assumed to be an attack on all members. Then NATO would be legally forced to declare war on Russia. Then you have WW3.

If I would describe to you the horrors my grandparents generation went through hearing the roll of artillery getting closer, the stench of the Soviet troops.

"Russia is about to send hundreds of thousands of men to Ukraine with (I kid you not) band instruments and rotten rifles.

This morning I woke up to the deceased head of a ukrainian soldier who had his eyes, tongue, and vocal chords removed before being murdered.  Russia mobilized at least one incarcerated cannibal who terrorized St. Petersburg. I watched the video of a mother and a daughter and a RUSSIAN soldier trying to save them early on being mowed down by Russian fire.  I watched a 12 year old girl run from Russian fire, and then later that same coat laying on the street covering the back of a person laying face down in the gutter, just like the red-coat girl in Schindler's List.  I watched them execute a father in front of his car filled with his family.  God knows what happened to them (we know).  They're currently torturing POWs.  They raped and looted and murdered entire families.

There is *no* ""common faith"".   Their Patriarch is telling the newly mobilized that death in Ukraine absolves them of all sins- even their religion is poison.  Those sins above?  The torture, the rape, the casual, senseless, drunken brutality?  The main Russian religious leader is saying to not even bother with minding your P's and Q's, because if you die over there (and let's be honest- after seeing your equipment, you're gonna die), you might as well satisfy your baser instincts.  Is *this* the ""common faith"" you're talking about?

Yes, afterwards we're all going to have to inhabit the same planet, but it's *going* to be with a *lot* more dead Russians.  *Russia* is seeing to that, and the ua is going to add to that.  Sure, people will all go back to buying Russian shit, but *nobody* will trust Russia, and I very much doubt if Russians will be able to go places after this war and harass people without getting fucked up.  Good.  FAFO.

For Bucha, and the forests of the dead in Kharkiv, and Izyium, and Mariupol, and Azovstal, and the POWs currently being tortured, and for *every* kid, and baby who watched their mother get ass-raped by a gang of Russian thugs, for *every* father who watched his daughter, son, or infant getting raped and murdered, before ending up in a ditch themselves, for the destroyed cities and villages, and for *every* soldier who was abandoned early on by their leadership in strategic locations who sold them out, I say *get out of Luhansk, Donetsk, Zaporizhzhia, Kherson, and Crimea, and the killings will stop.*

I'll never see Russians as civilized again.  That ship sailed with peering into their lives- it's all either skin-deep shallow parroting of ""the west"" that they so despise (while nonetheless living here so fucking always if given the chance), or so fucking depressing I can't imagine why they don't kill themselves.  I can't fathom the level of cowardice of a whole people that full-throatedly support genocide, yet will flee as soon as they're demanded to take part when it's not going their way. Perhaps my daughters will see them differently if the hopeful future.  Perhaps theirs.  Perhaps Russia will change- but I don't think they ever will.  But- whether they decide to change in the future or not- if Russians want to live, they need to surrender, or *fucking leave.*  There's not, like, a third option.  Nuclear weapons *be damned.* Leave, surrender, or die.",xp984u

I get that me wanting the worst for the russians isnt healthy, and I try not to, it can make a monster of you too, but I cant help thinking each time I see a dead russian, that its one less russian that can harm anyone on Ukraine. each time a drone drops a grenade, each time a tank gets popped, each time a bunker gets blown up, each time an ammo dump get blasted, less Ukrainians will die because of it.

This post is coming way too early. I understand the sentiment and logic, but the timing is off and it has no practical use.

There is no ""real"" dehumanising going on. Yet. And all the hundred of thousands of russians who have flet will mostly get a fair treatment.

Russia is still torturing, raping, killing, stealing etc.

On the front the dehumanisation has a practical use: It makes it easier to kill the enemy. Fine with me. 

Ukraine is doing exceptionally well in regards to taking care of the prisoners etc.

I am not saying that there aren't a few potential POWs who didn't make it - but could have. That's war.

It is way too early to state, that Russia will soon get back on the international stage. Waaaay too early.

Listen - we might still be in for a nuke next week.

For me Russia is edging towards nazi Germany. And is already now on a solid 2nd place.

It took nazi Germany a complete surrender, loss of land, bomded back to rubble and millions of deaths before they finally got a chance to work their way out of the hole. It took a whole generation and humiliation.

I will never let Russia skip the line. If they want back in they need to proof they are worth it and can be trusted.

It takes a generation at least. 

Meaning:
1. All land back to Ukraine
2. International Court
3. Pay reparation
4. Officially apologize. Atonement. Like the Germans.
5. Get rid of the Lenin and Stalin history washing. Russia needs to get its history right and stop worshipping mass murderers.

Ukrainians are fighting a just war but this stuff comes after even in a just war. 

My family is half located in Russia, half in Ukraine. I am a Crimean Tatar. I remember visiting family in Russia in the early 90s. In fact, a lot of family moved there because Ukraine was even worse at the time. A lot of people on Reddit cheer on death and destruction while staying far away from it. I find it very sad that people do this. Sometimes you need to kill, defend yourself, your nation and ethnic group. The moment you start to relish in it is troublesome. It will catch up with after the war, you will feel bad after the war. It is part of the reason I avoid these subs.

"Even the Germans weren‚Äôt as dehumanised in the 1940s! Well expect for the nazis of course. But still there were sympathisers. They did wrong things and even the same as what the Russians are doing, or as any military does (but we don‚Äôt talk about that)

The allies were more careful with the youth group, but also realised not every German supported hitler. They just could not speak out, only attempts to assassinate him which is perhaps enough to show and tell the allies they weren‚Äôt as happy either. 

Putin is not ending this war, no Russian soldier can just go ‚Äúlol yeah bye‚Äù and walk home. People are sitting too comfy in their homes to think that. Putin started this, he isn‚Äôt going to finish it ‚Äî he‚Äôs already embarrassed that it failed miserably at the start (maybe just maybe because no one knew why they were there) and claiming defeat will only him hurt and his ego. Hence the mobilisation of more  human beings to the slaughter. 

People need to stop lumping the bad and the good together. The bad and evil always buries the good ones who mean not harm. It is not easy to surrender, you have to think about not getting shot by your own so have to think where to run too but then your own can still be around. You find the Ukrainian troops, but how to surrender without being seen as a threat. 

There‚Äôs a whole process with surrendering, and one can be fed propaganda about it. I think there needs to be paper encouraging them all to surrender, maybe put down a telegram or something to show how well POWS are treated. 

To continue on this ramble of my thoughts. I think this is what Putin wants, he wants people to hate the Russians because hatred of unity can be bring together certain people that want to prolong the war, give Russia a reason to fight. I also feel the media really only shows what they want us to see, just saying, I feel they purposely only show the evil side.

"Nah, *I* agree but for a whole other reason than all the 'all russians must die crowd'. It is important to not dehumanize them. Why? When you do so, you take away responsibility from them. Then they will be like the school shooting kid, everyone hates him so what's a Columbine anyways, so he goes does it. In fact, it is the humanization of the orc which will kill the orc. One of the greatest take-aways from this war in the field of crime and punishment will be the surgical precision with which all evidence will be traced right to the individual perpetrators. No longer could a soldier hide away among the thousands, our technology will be able to find all their hiding places.

Dehumanization may feel righteous in the short term, but it actually invalidates the grievances of the victims as we only hold humans accountable and responsible for crimes. You would not blame an animal if that animal ate someone, it's because it isn't human and therefore we do not hold it to a high account. So we may not even be bothered with individual investigations due to this - just think about it. I know some of us would relish in seeing a firing squad take out scores of war criminals in a mass grave. But what will that do, besides preventing them from meeting their true justice with their crimes being publicly stated and their victims being honored through the rigorous proceedings which bring weight to the victims' plights and tearing away at the impunity and anonymity of the aggressor.

And, by the way, this is the same approach I would take to Nazis of Germany. Also very cool to watch the context of this in Mark Felton concentration camp liberation videos where US fighters had to try their hardest to not shoot up the nazis without due process.",xp984u

"It's always the problem with war propaganda, you build up the enemy as evil (granted in the case of russians it's not too much work) because it makes your fight righteous. But when peace talks come around suddently you are negatiating with evil so it seems crazy. We should not be as bloodthirsty as russian propaganda pretends us to be or we would give them justification.",xp984u

They are orcs who invaded a sovereign country. They don‚Äôt deserve to be viewed as human.,xp984u
"The OP is trying to envision a post war existence with ruzz that is based on a human existence.

The problem is that the OP does not take into account the sheer depravity of ruzz and it's populace.

What we are seeing right now is ruzz oligarchs raising their own paramilitary groups. They're not doing this out of the kindness in their hearts- they're doing it because they know they'll end up as regional warlords. Make no mistake, they will eat their own to include using their own nukes on each other.

There is no peaceful coexistence with ruzz. Perhaps the best plan would be to take a 20 mile ring around the entire country, turn it into an impassable DMZ and call it a day. The more mobilization dodgers other countries let in, the larger their problems will be.",xp984u
"Russians: Invade Ukraine, Bomb innocent civilians, torture and kill POW's, murder children, rape children, castrate men, kidnap thousands of Ukrainian children, destroy heritage sites, cause mass starvation in the third world, cut off millions of people to gas and energy supply, hold the world hostage to the threat of nuclear weapons. 

Pro-Ukraine Redditors: call russians orcs and wish the invaders dead....

&#x200B;

Yup checks out, seems like those pro-Ukrainian redditors are way out of line.",xp984u
"Don't try to change reddits mind, they're as open minded as boomers when it comes to that.

Ofc we have to be with Ukraine in this war but we should be pressuring governments to fuckin stop buying energy from Russia, instead of being all happy when some random Russian teenager forced into war gets his head crushed by some Ukrainian missile.

People don't understand that hate just generates more hate.",xp984u
"I agree with you and thank you for stating this.

WE are better than them. This is the reason why WE have freedom and a professional army. WE value life and it's one of the reasons why Russian troops will surrender - because of the humane treatment they will get. Dehumanization is the root cause of atrocities.",xp984u
"Dehumanizing is the inevitable result of all conflicts big or small.  It is serves the purpose of rationalising anger and violence.   Its very hard to be angry at a ""person"" that you talk to...very easy to kill, rape, torture an ""animal"".  The other psychological  trick is to justify these attrocities through religion.   War is simply hell on earth,  and pray we dont lose our humanity as we try to survive it.",xp984u
"Human means war. That has been applied for thousands of years and will still not end in the nearest future.

Deal with that, pseudo-humanist dummie.",xp984u
"I think it's really good that you're touching on the dehumanising aspect of war and talking about the future after the war and sound genuinely concerned for everyone that's been affected by it all. But I think a lot of people are actually venting online as a way of showing support for Ukraine, Many of us are horrified by what Putin and his government have done to the people of another country, remembering it was the Russians that invaded Ukrainian territory.  And after seeing the brutality inflicted by the Russian troops, most people are quite rightly enraged by what they've seen, we can't hide from it, it's the curse of the modern era that we can go online at any given time and our senses to be assaulted by what we're witnessing on a daily basis. I don't doubt that some people have overloaded on the blood guts and death and to a degree have become desensitised to it all. The problem is it can affect us all without realising it's happening at the time. I'm an ex soldier and it wasn't until after I came home that I started having problems. And I'm concerned that some people who are seeing war unfolding on a screen in their living rooms are setting themselves up for some serious issues down the track, let alone the poor men and women who are actually fighting. Sometimes people can only handle horrible situations by mentally and emotionally distancing themselves from the horror. I don't think they mean to become less human, I think the problem is simply we are human. Sorry for the long winded reply.",xp984u
"I'm afraid it is the nature of war. It's hard to kill a man you see as human. They must be thought of as less than. What soldiers must not lose is their humanity. The knowledge that a deed must be done, but not to draw pleasure from it. A hunter who shoots a deer does it for food, or management of the species, but not the desire to watch an animal to suffer and die.",xp984u
"This is part of the process, happens almost every time.      Are there good Russians, yes, but they come from a pathological, chronic horror show that simply changes leaders over the years.",xp984u
Yeah ive been noticing some actual xenophobia towards russians. Maybe we should stop that,xp984u
"It is a well described phenomenon. Using dehumanizing vocabulary towards one social or ethnic group lowers the threshold of violence towards it. It also lowers the threshold to be less empathetic etc.

If you are fighting an enemy on the battlefield it is quite understandable. It is more bearable to kill ""orcs"" than uneducated, stupid, blinded by propaganda humans. 

Russia does this all the time against Ukrainians, our right wing parties try doing so against refugees, the NSDAP did so against Jews, pic your choice. 

And of course that doesn't mean that you as an example turn violent, but the chances are increased and if a lot of people are involved there will be violence.

And don't get me wrong. Ukrainians are fighting a just cause, I hope russia loses this war today, people in charge get punished. Also, for all I can tell, russians use warcrimes strategically and a waaaaaay more frequently in general.",xp984u
god loves russians,xp984u
I guess there must be some examples of Russian troops showing some humanity somewhere. Let's try and find them tongive a more balanced perspective...,xp984u
they are not humans,xp984u
"I get you OP, not every russian soldier that got captured is a rapist or murderer and the conscripts are send there against there will. Even now the mibilization takes place the protest are minimal, russian people are brainwashed or scared for Putin.

I get the anger, but do as the soldier of the UAF and stay human and treat those who need help with humanity",xp984u

The first point is just straight up wrong or misrepresented. Germany wanted to provide it as a grant instead of a loan. The package was structured as a loan which means Ukraines debt burden increases with it. Germany wants this 9 billion in aid to be a grant which would eleviate that burden.,vw5fde
"Where‚Äôs the source for the title? Please share. For all I can tell, OP is a Russian troll. Tried finding information regarding this and cannot.",vw5fde
"Booo the 9B aid package was structured as a loan, which would burden Ukraine's debt. They want it as a grant.",vw5fde
This post echoes Russian propaganda which seeks to divide Ukraine allies and supporters and drive a wedge into NATO. The west can work through problems of a multi-prong approach without resorting to vitriol. Germany has been one of the big important supplier of mat√©riel for Ukraine,vw5fde
"This reading sounds complete crazy.   


Of course there is no need to give any pretext for Russia and to prevent transports from main Russia to Kaliningrad. Inner Russian transit that was also not the target of EU sanctions.

Of course the damaged gas turbines need to be fixed and this has nothing to do with Ukraine.

And of course Germany is not against Russia. It is Russia that is acting against the world community and this facing the sanctions by all European players.",vw5fde
All the Russian propaganda summarized in just a single sentance.,vw5fde
Well if Germany never got rid of their nuclear power plants and never decided to be so reliant on Russia gas then this would of never happened. They were warned by many leaders that being so dependent on Russia will backfire. Who would of thought ü§∑.,vw5fde
Thank you op for spreading misinformation /s,vw5fde
"While I understand the OP sentiment I think Germany is a victim of its own policies, many of which were shortsighted, the fact that some past German leadership was very ""Russian"" friendly, and that to make the changes necessary can not be done on the turn of a coin.

Germany needs natural gas.  Where is it to obtain it from?  What else can it do?  These are questions not easily answered and any answers forthcoming are complicated very timely solutions that don't resolve the problem today, tomorrow or even this yr.",vw5fde
"Russian ties run deep in the halls of power in Germany. 

Putin sent his girls to school there to be raised by a German banker for Dresdner Bank. This man became the top executive for Nordstream. Gerhard Schroder also has major ties with Russian business and politics. 

There's a reason why they deliver the least compared to their public promises and statements of support.  Russia and their billions of Euros controls a lot in Germany.",vw5fde
"Germany on the wrong side of history?!? 

INCONCEIVABLE!",vw5fde
Please source any of this before causing trouble.,vw5fde
Smells bad,vw5fde
"Germany is paying for gas it can't receive because the pipeline turbine are not there (those are long term contract btw). So Russia is getting paid and doesn't even have to send the gas. 

Those turbine exist to provide gas to Europe (Germany), and until Europe can find alternative energy source (which they are working on), Europe  (Germany)   
 will continue buying mainly gas (and some oil) from Russia. And in preparation of winter, Europe (Germany) need to replenish their stock or else be at the mercy of Russia stopping export (gas is mostly use for heating, so winter + no heat = big problem).

It doesn't help Ukraine to put Europe (Germany) in trouble, because Ukraine support will disappear if Europe (Germany) citizens are revolting.

Also, the money Russia is receiving is  useless if it can purchase what it need.",vw5fde
"Considering how russians treated the Germans at the end of WW2, I'm baffled as to why they are so buddy-buddy/reliant on them. I guess the pull of cheap energy, or just $ in particular triumphs over all situations.",vw5fde

"I'm just so happy that the United States and the UK will continue proving support. As well as Eastern European countries and other allies. While I'm sure Germany has helped quite a bit, the amount of harm they seem to be inflicting does not compensate for it. Do they really want to end up on the wrong side again?",vw5fde
Next thing we will hear about is the Schroeder-Lavrov Non-Aggression Pact. Meanwhile Russia and Germany sign a secret deal to split Poland while Russia claims the Baltics and goes to war with Finland this winter.,vw5fde

There is more Nuance to that as usual...,vw5fde
They don't want to be. But they are bent over by Russia. They need to sort their shit out. Because they're the weak link. I don't know why we should go against our morals and sanctions to keep them propped up on russian blood gas. They don't run the EU now.,vw5fde
You fuckin commie,vw5fde
Germany is always about money first,vw5fde
Ruzzian trolls much,vw5fde
"Unfortunately with the situation Germany has put itself into, they have an obligation to their people first and foremost. I can't fault them too much on that front. However they should have never made themselves reliant on Russia from the start.

And all these comments shitting on Germany are just causing more division in the pro-Ukraine bloc, especially when Germany has been helping a decent amount. I'd rather have them on our side than not.",vw5fde
"How about you fucking read the article before posting wild things on the internet you troll. 
You claim to support Ukraine, but don‚Äôt even take the time to get behind what‚Äôs really going on! 

It‚Äôs about the payment modality not, if Ukraine e should get it. Some European countries want it to be given as a loan which Germany refuses because it would further increase dept. 

You little fuck. Honestly. Go and troll somewhere else you fuck",vw5fde
"another biased post bashing Germany for no reason...  
Did you even try to get background information on the named topics?  
Do you know what it means for EU when German economy collapses?

With every post like this UA loses german supporters or backs russian friendly extremists in Ger, that should be mentioned. Or is it the purpose?",vw5fde
"Well if anyone hasnt guessed it yet, Germany doesnt have a feasible source of gas or oil yet and will keep up their end so russia doesnt cut them off entirely. Which would completely sink the German economy and pretty much the entire country because they have thought of a way to survive without Russia since...... Jan? Feb? Still havent figured anything out yet.... They're royally fucked",vw5fde
There is no source for this,vw5fde
This fixation on Germany needs to stop. They may be notoriously late and constantly tied by bureaucracy one way or another but this is too much.,vw5fde
"We sent weapons to Ukraine. And we need the turbine because without it we would have a hard winter. An american general said he understood our position in this war. We can't support as good as other countries, but once the war is over, we will be the people who send the money to repair Ukraine. Our time to support Ukraine will come.",vw5fde
"Tactics. Germany needs to survive through next winter when we know Russian gas will be cut off. They want to make that a Russian decision, not one using the excuse that they did not get the gas turbine. Meanwhile they can fill their reserves more. It is just a fact that German support will be far more difficult if their population is rioting in the streets because they cannot heat their homes. More important to the strategic goal is that more weapons and monetary support to Ukraine ramps up. The story itself is clickbait and may even be untrue.",vw5fde
"Fucking Germany üôÑ

Their actions are outright confusing at times.",vw5fde
Europeans being spineless?  color me surprised.,vw5fde
"For Kaliningrad: It's simple and logical, is it popular? No. But it's like Canada telling the US they aren't allowed to move things to Alaska. Kaliningrad is Russian territory. So it's legally just iffy to tell them they can't move goods there. Otherwise you would have to enforce a No Fly Zone and you're back to the point where you would have to enforce it against civilian planes most likely.

For Siemans Canada: We need the turbine fixed, simple as that. Canada made an exception and Germany needs Gas for the forseeable future. And it's not  even clear we'll be getting gas from Russia after the turbine maintenance is done. So it's stupid to argue about it.

As for the 9bn Aid package: It's a money issue, not a gas issue. And we wouldn't be violating sanctions.

But yeah, keep bashing Germany. That'll help win support. What do people want? We shut off gas completely and basically shut down most of our industry within weeks, fall into an economic state that will fall into chaos and destabilize the Western part of Europe with civil unrest? Make sure that none of the aid will go to Ukraine because we won't be can't be the guarantor for any of those aid packages and basically will fuck up most of Europe in the process? Yeah cool, that sounds awesome.

PEople are acting like we can snap our fingers and make magic nuclear plants pop up like mushrooms and then replace the essential gas needed for industry appear out of thin air and get stored in magic sheds. 

Is it fucked up that we're so reliant on the shitty eastern bloc gas station? Yes. Can we magically change that within days? No. We simply can't. So what cool propositions do you have? I mean other than going ""Wah wah wah Germany still buys gas from Russia!!! Wah wah wah! You're evil!!""",vw5fde
">not dropping every responsibility that is not pumping money into ukraine
OMG LITTERALY HITLER!!!

This is not how the world works",vw5fde
"Germany has continuously destroyed Europe long after the fall of the third reich. They run the EU basically which is why people voted for Brexit (I didn‚Äôt before people jump on me with downvotes). I‚Äôve learnt that instead of just screeching about the brexit decision, it‚Äôs better to look at the the reasons why other countries are looking to follow suit; Germany has Europe by the balls.",vw5fde
"No, it is not. And for fucks sake stop downvoting my comments showing up how hipocrite is Germany. Right now Ukraine has a better chance from Santa Claus than Germany (Germany has never liked Ukraine, the abuse by Nazis over Ukraine show that). Germany and France need the Buffer zone but it has grown thinner, now is just Ukraine and Moldova (Poland and the Baltic States are no longer the Buffer zone from Germany and France) so what they do? Keep the buffer zone as long as they can: they are not their people, they are not their voters. Because even in war politicians are politicians (the crude defense against the help for Ukraine in many countries shows exactly that).

So if you want to keep believing Germany is on Ukraine side (you are going to be disappointed) and if you think comments like this don't help to the Ukraine-Germany ""relationship"" then you really need to have a reality check and leave social media for a while.

I root for Ukraine but the Germans (as a government not as the population of the country, now we need to clarify that. OK when I talk about Germans and Germany I'm talking about their politicians (elected by their people ffs))... Germans don't give a fuck about Ukraine and I think we need to start to not give a fuck about Germany and how the sanctions against a terrorist country is affecting them after willingly submit their soberany to Russia... They got it coming as well...",vw5fde

"To be honest, Germany isn't as bad as Italy and The Netherlands.",vw5fde

"No source, no foundation, no context: moving on‚Ä¶‚Ä¶.",vw5fde
"1. Missleading -> see deatils in other comments
2. Yes. Because germany needs ruzzian gas still, and will need it unteil end of 2023 at least. Merlel made us very dependant, it takes time to replace it. Otheriwse the germany economy would crash -> no economy -> no money to send help.
3. True, they want to protect Lithunia from one sided russian aggression. Also it's not really important for the war, if K√∂nigsberg gets Vodka or not.",vw5fde

Maybe the US should stop sending all of the tax payer money to protect a Europe that doesn‚Äôt give enough of a fuck to pay their own share!  I am so sick of this shit.  We don‚Äôt even have the money we are giving!  They just keep printing paper!  I can‚Äôt.  I just can‚Äôt.  Buy 2000 axes give them to 2000 crazy Russians and set them loose in Moscow. That is a better plan that all this horse shit.,vw5fde
"Germany should have never been against Russia. But provided that as a consequence of WW2, they are still under American occupation and don't have an independent foreign policy. It's in Germany's national interest to take gas from Russia in the near future. The blockade of kaliningrad was a foolish move by Lithuania. It would be better if the EU put some sense into the Lithuanians. Germany should do everything to secure it's industry and economy regardless of what ukraine or anyone else says.",vw5fde
Doesn‚Äôt Germany get its gas from Russia?,vw5fde

"TLDR of the [article](https://www.lapresse.ca/actualites/2022-05-06/retour-du-tireur-d-elite-wali/la-guerre-c-est-une-deception-terrible.php)

The title while factual is a little bit misleading. The issue mentions by Wali in the article are specifics to the foreign legion part of the ""Legion normande"" (a group of foreign fighters who form a brigade of +100, likely with French speaking soldiers).  There was contention with the commander of the brigade causing some to leave and take 500K$ of weapon to form another unit. The Ukrainian government didn't seem to be very involve in managing foreign legion. Finding food, a place to stay and weapon was difficult, and they weren't put on the front right away.

Wali decide to come back from Ukraine after an incident where two Ukrainian conscript decide to go smoking in the wood near the front and got blown up by a tank a few meter from Wali. Wali (an experience sniper) was shocked by those death (he did warn the conscript not to do that) and decide to come back home to his wife and child.

&#x200B;

IMO, from the article, it seem there was a lack of coordination with the foreign legion at the start of the war. Perhaps the Ukrainian army decide to favor their own soldier first (for equipment/food) or perhaps there was enough for everyone. We do see that foreign units (US or Belarus) are bringing/buying their own equipment (night vision, scope, mode of transport) instead of getting them from the Ukrainian army.

Integrating 20K soldiers with diverse experience and speaking different language while managing to stop an invasion was too much logistic for the Ukrainian. To be effective, those foreign legions should likely be manage independently, with their own logistic and command structure, similar to mercenary like the Wagner group.",uks3vy
[Here is a google translated article from Montreal.](https://www-lapresse-ca.translate.goog/actualites/2022-05-06/retour-du-tireur-d-elite-wali/la-guerre-c-est-une-deception-terrible.php?_x_tr_sl=fr&_x_tr_tl=en&_x_tr_hl=en&_x_tr_pto=sc),uks3vy
But Wali does not hide his desire to return there despite everything. ‚ÄúYou never know when foreign fighters will make a difference on the ground. It's like a fire extinguisher: it's useless until the fire catches. ¬ª,uks3vy
"Could be Wali disinformation. When strong, act weak. In that case,  counter- offensive will look impressive.  More likely, this is a shitty headline based on half-truths, innuendo, and dubious conclusions,  just like so many other headlines here.",uks3vy
"This personal blog does not seem to indicate he has left.

[https://www.torcheepee.com](https://www.torcheepee.com)",uks3vy
"Sounds like he didn't exactly get with the best units, mostly either western volunteer groups or a lesser-trained Ukrainian volunteer unit. It's too bad he didn't get a chance to fight with one of the experienced units, but that's war. As for the misleading bit about 'profiteering and desertion in the ranks', the only mentions of that in the article, were in regards to western volunteers in the  slapped-together volunteer units, not Ukrainian soldiers.",uks3vy
Only thing about this I can find is reddit.,uks3vy
"I read French, he is saying that the Ukrainians ware not ready to integrate the foreign fighters. They had to create their own groups and there was a lack of equipment even basic. A lot of new conscripts in the Ukrainian army which reduces its efficiency. He may go back if required.",uks3vy
[deleted],uks3vy
I‚Äôm more surprised that he says he never shot anyone.,uks3vy
There's a ton of disinformation surrounding him. Russia claimed to have killed like 3 different times I think.,uks3vy
"This is Russian disinformation. The Ukrainian center for countering disinformation published this to their Telegram channel: 

‚ùå russian propaganda media spread the story of the disappointment of Canadian mercenaries in the military operation in Ukraine due to insane incompetent commanders and acute lack of weapons, because of which they leave the area of hostilities
üîªWarning: it's a manipulation!",uks3vy
"So now we are complaining, like leaving a bad review about a war.  He only gave it a 1 star for volunteer fighters.  
Sounds a lot like what happens during every war?  One side or both would usually fit that description throughout history.",uks3vy
100% skeptical of this information.,uks3vy
"Why does this come as a no surprise? It has already been proven with all the needless losses they suffered from saboteurs roaming around freely within the country that has allowed for damaging attacks from the Russians via missile strikes. 

The countless losses of advanced weaponry provided by the west that was critical for their defense were reportedly captured. This will only provide the enemy with advanced weaponry technologies and also allows them to hit back against the Ukrainians with them.  This has evidently proven that some Ukrainian units are inefficient or lack the ability to fight.

It is not only the Russians that have suffered drastic losses but also the Ukrainians too. I am hoping they would iron out these problems soon as it would be critical to the survival of not only Ukraine but also the other neutral countries around the Russian western borders.",uks3vy
"He came back because he almost got killed . In a trench two Ukrainians got up to smoke and they got hit by a tank, both died",uks3vy
"Well let's hope he goes back in with some pals for backup. 
But if the Ukrainian freedom fighters are so bad at being team players and getting organised and can stop pilfering arms then maybe they may just be able to make something from a pigs ear.

If the Ukrainians freedom fighters are as bad as he says, it goes to show just how fucking piss poor organised the Russians really are then",uks3vy

"His colleague had an interview on the CBC a few days ago,  it‚Äôs on Youtube.

He complimented the Ukrainians and their bravery and said the world has not done enough to help them and why he came to fight the Russians.

Wali‚Äôs criticism was the shape of the volunteers and the lack of hardware.",uks3vy
It does sound a bit like he expected to be treated as a celebrity. The foreign fighter and conscript units were never going to be a priority for equipment. But at the same time it did seem like Ukraine handled it poorly and needed a better screening system for volunteers and be prepared to support them properly once they were their. Nobody is going to stick around to fight for free if they‚Äôre scraping for food and equipment.,uks3vy
"Wali didn't join the Ukrainian army but a mercenary group. From what I gather from a French Canadian media outlet who are quoting him, he didn't get any closer than 40 kilometres front and said he only fired two shots into a windows to scare people.

Did you find this article in Russia? LOLOLOLOL,uks3vy
He probably wishes a more trained operation. I can see his frustration. He probably said with training this UA army would win. Let‚Äôs not forget they are fighting a super power. Fortunately for them the Russians soldiers are fighting for rubles .,uks3vy

It‚Äôs useless in this fight.,wpgceq
"Nothing would change, the Use of a AC130 would require air superiority and a fighter escort. Plus anytime a Manpad would fire at it it would have to retreat out of the battlefield.",wpgceq
Not much difference - a single ac130 isn't going to turn the tide. A fleet of Ah64s with trained pilots and all thr infrastructure- that's the kind of thing that could turn tables. Impossible though due to time and cost.,wpgceq

"A few things to note: melted metal guardrail is visible at the start of the video.

There are two sets of tracks on this line.

Rail bridges often do have gravel, when there is a full rail bed and not just a steel skeleton. The gravel soaks up the oils and makes it so maintenance workers can walk around normally. Where I live, all the rail bridges that are not metal skeletons have the exact same amount of gravel on the bridge as in neighboring areas, it is a continuous surface. (*this doesn't apply to urban passenger light-rail, of course)

If the structure is damaged and they use it anyway, it could take days or weeks for further cracks to appear at which time it would either fall into the water, or they might notice and stop using it. For the people deciding if it is usable or not, the Russian preference is usually just to say ""Go!"" and if it collapses, blame the explosion not the inspection. Decision-makers seem to have so little technical knowledge about the thing they're overseeing that few people might even know it wasn't a normal risk. If they say don't use it, and somebody else says do use it, and they try it and it lasts a week and falls over, they might still think it proves the ""use it"" person right.",xz0nw1
Wait till daylight it will be clear enough then whether the trains are running,xz0nw1
"Did anyone confirmed it really went through the bridge? 

I find it rather suspicious they have it repaired so fast. Just checking for damage  of rails and construction should take at least a day. 

Smells fake AF, all things considering.",xz0nw1
Typical Russian lies.,xz0nw1
They never ever gonna drive no train full of tanks or any other military vehicles to crimea on that bridge. Just give up and realize your country is fucked. Crimea is ukraine üá∫üá¶Slava Ukrainiüá∫üá¶,xz0nw1
"I hooe this is fake but the rail-part was not hit. Only some busted carts and some damaged rail.

I hope they can brake the phylons and send it all to the bottom of the sea.",xz0nw1
"Sorry to disappoint, but that's not a bridge. That is gravel. There's no gravel on that bridge.",xz0nw1
Bullshit. Who moved the burning train?,xz0nw1
"Or ruzzia runs a train on some track somewhere.
No evidence that this is even near the bridge let alone on it",xz0nw1
"Thats a bullshit video. I mean come on... if you post a video about the bridge, the train should at minimum be on a bridge to make is convincing",xz0nw1
Well Satellite imagery as of a couple of hours ago still had all the core rail cars on the bridge as some of them are still smoking.  So to say I am skeptical of this video is the understatement of the century.  Not to mention the immediate structure below the hottest point had significant evidence of buckling that cannot be repaired so easily.  I could go on but the essence is that whatever this video may be it is not the damaged section of the rail track.,xz0nw1
Eh even if they DID fix it already!! I'm sure nobody in Kyiv thought they were gonna shut everything down the first time out. But now Vlad's got ANOTHER headache to worry about until the next time!,xz0nw1
"Notice this was filmed at night.  Also, the rails of the Crimean bridge looks nothing like the ones they are showing here.",xz0nw1
"It seems obvious to me, the speed for which that bridge was repaired, it is very important to russia‚Äôs war effort.

In other words, it needs to be obliterated",xz0nw1
"If it‚Äôs genuine, then it‚Äôs very impressive repair work. Network Rail would take 3 months to do that and that‚Äôs without the risk of being bombed.",xz0nw1
They don‚Äôt put ballast on railway bridge.,xz0nw1
Where is the bridge?,xz0nw1
Cargo 200,xz0nw1
"It's their right to do it...yeah right.
ü§£",xz0nw1
"Rybar is not very optimistic about the repair:

'Under the most optimistic scenario, traffic on the bridge can be fully restored in four to five weeks.  
In fact, most likely, the terms will be somewhat longer. But if the work is given top priority, and the stand for the manufacture of spans has not been dismantled since 2018, then the restoration will hardly exceed two to three months.""",xz0nw1
Let Putin be the conductor!,xz0nw1
Russia has a completely different idea of danger.,xz0nw1
"They put out the fires; removed the damaged cars; repaired the infrastructure; and replaced the damaged rails, sleepers, and signal paths; over sea waters in 24hrs?

Idunno... I don't see Russia having the required technical capacity... Where did you get this headline?",xz0nw1
Looking at satellite photos there are 2 rail lines on the bridge so trains can go either direction. Most likely the one that the fuel cars were on is screwed for the near future but they don‚Äôt need to remove those cars to drive another train past it. It will complicate and slow train logistics (and idk if they are game to try it loaded with 50 tonne tanks) but won‚Äôt completely block rail transport for now.,xz0nw1
"""Hey guys...maybe we cant win a war in couple of days bu we can repair rails in just one or two... behoooold our mighty power...""",xz0nw1

"I hate seeing Russians harassing Ukrainian refugees in the west. Russian moles have been undermining western societies. Russian spies killed people in sovereign nations (eg Skripal) blew up buildings (eg Vrbƒõtice), infiltrated western institutions (eg Maria Adela).

Ukrainian children are being kidnapped, Ukrainian towns are getting bombarded, Ukrainian lands occupied, Ukrainianian men and women raped and tortured, while Russians are partying in the west showing Z signs.

So yes, I am pro the visa ban. To my understanding Russian refugees are welcome per the new EU rules - that I agree too.",x2d5uj
Isolation worked very well in Northkorea. And i think it will work with North KoruZZia as well.,x2d5uj
"Nah, I'm cool with banning all russians. If it doesn't make people there anti-putinists, then they can all live like pro-putinist until it finally collapses some time in the future like ussr.",x2d5uj
"Who the fuck needs any of these Russians who been brainwashed since birth in their countries? So you're saying you wanna  spend valuable resources on Russians, when you have countless Ukrainians left homeless and without a pot to piss in. Not even considering the fact that there is considerable number of poor Europeans who could use those resources.",x2d5uj
"Russians have made russia for what it has been and what it is today. It's russians duty to remake russia if they ever want to take any part of outside world. 

Being an asshole of the world for centuries has consequences. So no thank you. Isolating every orc in Mordor is the only way to go.",x2d5uj
How do you explain all of the arson and fires in ruzzia? Protest takes different forms.,x2d5uj
"Add a ""Ukraine fee"" for visa issuing. The money goes directly into the account of Ukraine.",x2d5uj
"""I think we should to evacuate all russians, who are against Putin, from Russia so they could protest freely and start a new better life""

how do you plan to evacuate them? it not like you can drive a bus to russia and pick them up. how do you find them? and if you succed - you think that russia will care that some guys protest OUTSIDE of their country? most russians dont even watch foreign TV",x2d5uj
"How many russians are oppositors? I feel even bad when i see those brave russians like Ilya Yashin being arrested. For what? They deserve a better country. Instead, russian people doesn't even value their sacrifice, they don't care. Those brave men and women are losing their freedom for a soulless, dead inside population who couldn't care less about their fates.

Russians need to take care of themselves. 30 years of good relationship with Europe don't change them, so is worthless giving them visas.",x2d5uj
Fuck that. They should remain in there own shit country and reform it from the inside. Russian tourists visas should be banned and any seeking asylum should be heavily scrutinized before granting asylum.,x2d5uj
How will you sort out anti and pro putinist? Show a z sticker and see who goes for it?,x2d5uj
"No. They should, like the germans be forced to deal with their problems instead of letting everyone else do it for them.",x2d5uj
"Allowing Russians indiscriminately to enter the rest of Europe and US and everywhere else will end like it did in Ukraine: full scale Russian invasion under pretext of ""protecting their Russian speakers"" whom they inserted in other countries for that exact purpose",x2d5uj
"No you‚Äôre wrong, get ahold of your government before you worry about coming to other countries",x2d5uj
"That may be good for someone's economy... Russian people have changed nothing in more than hundred years. The change they made in 1917 was from middle ages to stone age so I would count on them,  üêë .",x2d5uj
"Again, the ukrainian refugees in the german daycare that got lit on fire today would beg to differ. As would all the russians I know from Brighton Beach that dream about russian Iskanders ""showing america who's boss""",x2d5uj
"No the other than the ones escaping persecution and looking for asylum  they should stay home and work at fixing thier country. My personal belief is one of the reasons we have so many failed states is we let everyone who could be working to make a change leave.  

I do not have a problem with the helpless ""Women, Children, and the elderly"" running away from bombs and missile strikes I do have a problem with those leaving who could work to make thier country better.  Ukraine is a good example of this as those who can work to make the Russian Army go away have stayed and  the ones who would be in the way of this goal have temporarily left the country.",x2d5uj

There are enough potato drinking meatheads abroad as it is. Let Russians stay in Russia.,x2d5uj

"Taking an ""easy way out"" will be the only thing that would come to mind for some as an attempt to escape ruzzia. If whole world turns away from you, if your country calls you a traitor and tries to put you away for having different opinion, for caring and worrying about ukraine, for trying to send them help. If your own family starts to ridicule you for it, calling you an idiot and telling that you shouldn't care about such things and live here and now. You're alone, among sick people, it is hard mentally.

People have to understand that this war hurts both sides, hell, whole world even. Ukrainians have it worse, there is no doubt. But we are all people, and we all should fight for our peaceful future together, no matter the nationality.
Hate only breeds more hate.
Those who support wars, any kind of discrimination should be treated with hate they deserve.",x2d5uj
"No, we don't have to help them leave their ''motherland'', we just have to encourage them to kill their ''father'' of their land and souls = Putin",x2d5uj
"Hey mate, i respectfully disagree. By allowing russians in, you give the chance of spies and russcists into the western world. 

The complications would be hackers entering western countries to hack voting systems and spread false information. Or rather divide us from within. Russicst that said are innocent who act as spies to enter the western countries and protest and harming  protesters whom are pro-ukraine.

By letting russcist into the western world, you give them the chance of enjoying our life as a Democratic country but at the same time the chance to ruin us from within.

Also, russians did not prevent putin from getting into power. They elected this president and they should suffer the consequences. 

You preach of russians who are against the war and putin should be given mercy, what about the Ukrainians being tortured, killed and forced into filtration camps?

War is WAR. Its not some charity for morality. Get that in your head. 

It has been 6 months. Russians who wants to leave the country should have done that by now. BUT they arent because they don‚Äôt feel the consequence of the sanctions fully YET. However, a sane human would know its either time to fight or flight and based on the cowardiness of the russian people they should have flight. However, they chose to blissfully ignore the situation. Hence, they should be banned from moving to the west as time was given to them and now it puts a major risk for spies and hackers to infiltrate the west and divide us.",x2d5uj
"As a result, America's People's Republic in closest 100 years",x2d5uj
"No.  The vast majority of the citizens of a country never have any inkling of the atrocities done by that country.  In all honesty, countries are mostly a fiction.  Citizens are powerless to change the powers that be, ignorant of what is happening, and carefully conditioned to believe in their rulers' worldview.

This is true even in the West with its relative freedom and information.  How much more in Russia with a brutal dictatorship and censorship?

Blame the regime and hammer it.  Kill the troops because we must.  But the Russian people are in the same boat as the rest of us.  Blaming them makes about as much sense as blaming a hostage during a bank robbery.",t3z2z2
Dude there are mass protests in Moscow and St Petersburg. They are risking their lives and freedom protesting the war.,t3z2z2
America has also fought wars people didn‚Äôt agree with and protested yet the still couldn‚Äôt stop them. Much easier said than done for citizens to stop a war from their own country.,t3z2z2
"This has to be an American, no one else has this level of lack of self-awareness",t3z2z2
By your reasoning the US should be in the stone age for all the war is producing world wide. Sanctions are economic warfare. Double standards...,t3z2z2
I mean the sanctions placed on them will cripple their economy into the 20th century if the analysts are correct. IF we all end up surviving this whole ordeal that is. Theres also the possibility of everything being gone in a flash lol,t3z2z2
So you saying that if the people in power in your country declares war on another country then you are also liable to be bombed for being a citizen. Fucking idiot,t3z2z2
You think every single Russian citizen is part of the attack on Ukraine?,t3z2z2
People are desperate to cling onto the fictional that civilians are innocent.  They are not and have never been.  I hold my fellow Americans guilty of warmongering just as I do the Russian people.  Russia simply can't get away with as much evil because they don't care to use diplomacy to hide the knife.,t3z2z2

"Fuck him and his western apologist line. As the Russians well know, NATO is a defensive alliance and the expansion represented the sovereign actions of nations that lived under the Soviet yoke and vowed never again.

"Does this Mearsheimer also cover domestic violence issues? 

I am looking for an article on how it's the fault of wives when they get battered and when they run to the woman's shelter, it's ok for the husband to come and  drag them back home.

That is where Ukraine is right now. Russia is abusive and Ukraine's role for Russia would be to create a more comfortable life for Russians. Look at those in the far East of Russia, how they got there, what they do for Russia, and their quality of life.",uku4ro
The good professor is an expert in navel gazing and whataboutism.......he sees everything through the narrow prism of geopolitical realities in which Ukrainians have zero say in their destiny - to prevent a war with Russia his solution is the enslavement of Ukrainians under Putin's regime....in effect he has become an apologist for a war criminal and this is how history will judge or forget him...,uku4ro

"I remember reading this in an undergrad poli sci class, I wouldn‚Äôt call it drivel though. Mearsheimer is one of the most accredited and influential realists and I think the article reflects the unfortunate reality of dealing with competing spheres of influences and a reluctance of accepting that a certain country is not a major power anymore. Yea obviously the Ukrainians should be able to write their own destiny without fear of repercussions from the kremlin trying to maintain their old sphere of influence but at the same time the EU and NATO should not have been on the fence in terms of their commitment to Ukraine and their eastern expansion but it‚Äôs also complex in terms of the political situation in the Ukraine at the time with Yanukovych playing off the EU and Putin. Theirs so much nuance to it and theirs lots of underlying causes and past events that happened that have shaped this current conflict and I do think the title is super misleading as you can‚Äôt solely blame the west when you can see live the atrocities Russian troops are committing. I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs an apologist article but more of a ‚Äúthis shit happened in Georgia and it‚Äôs going to happen again‚Äù in the most lamest way I can think of putting it at 3 a.m

They have more pressing problems closer to home and attacking in to Russia would be a propaganda coup for the Russians.,tn3f0q
What's the point? To unite Russians and make it easier for Putin to start full draft to army?,tn3f0q
The most useful targets that Ukraine's special forces could realistically hit right now are all in Ukraine,tn3f0q
"A better use would be to sabotage the rail networks underneath Russian supply trains. Break a rail takes a day to fix, derail a loaded transport and it'll be a week before they worry about the tracks",tn3f0q
And do what? this isn't a movie,tn3f0q
An ammo depot not far from the Ukrainian border exploded a couple weeks ago. I imagine it didn't explode on its own.,tn3f0q
this post is very evident that some ppl view this war as some video game or movie from the comfort of their homes,tn3f0q
because its a stupid fucking idea.,tn3f0q

Really bad idea.  After winning the hearts and minds of the entire world it would be insane to basically turn terrorist like the Chechen's did.  Besides Russia doesn't have ready reserves and Ukraine is a target rich environment.,tn3f0q
You‚Äôve played too many video games,tn3f0q
As of right now Ukraine is defending its land. Ukraine has not declared war on russia and did not attack any russian city. Just because it gives us a moral advantage over russians. While we are defending our lives - the whole world will stand behind us.,tn3f0q
Why would they??,tn3f0q

There s like 10% of the Russian army in Ukraine. There s like 90% of that same army in Russia. What are the special forces gonna do fighting outnumbered? It makes more sense to defend their homes.,tn3f0q
It‚Äôs possible people are already in Russia waiting for an opportunity.,tn3f0q
Sounds like a suicide mission. They are not russian VDV...,tn3f0q

"That's one less orc to worry about. The less orcs on Ukrainian soil the better, one small victory for Ukraine. Slava Ukraini.",votr9f
"I guess people are angry.  Angry at what we hear each day that the Russians are doing to innocent Ukrainians. Hearing about the  massacres, rapes, executions of civilians, torture, indiscriminate bombings of apartments buildings and shopping malls makes people very angry. 

Ukraine was not a threat to Russia.  Even the expansion of NATO only threatens Russia's ability to threaten and invade other countries.  This is an unjust war.  

When I see Ukrainians fighting back and stalling Russian advances, destroying Russian tanks, and killing Russian soldiers, I feel a small sense of justice.  When Ukrainians manage to attack military targets closer to the border I am elated. 

When I see mutilated Russian soldiers I think that maybe those photos will be seen by ordinary Russians and their families and maybe, just maybe, they will realize that their government is duping them.  That this war is a waste of human life.  

I realize a lot of the soldiers are conscripts who probably do not want to be there.  And it is sad that they have given up their lives for such an unjust war.  But if enough of them are killed, then maybe public opinion in Russia will turn and end the war as it did in Afghanistan in the 80's.",votr9f

They are the products of generations of brainwashed alcoholics who were made to believe that besides the horrible conditions they live in, mother ruzzia is still the greatest country in the world and they should go out there and make their leader proud. ruzzia should be demilitarized and one way of doing that is killing as many ‚Äúsoldiers‚Äù as possible. they don‚Äôt care about human lives. they have always been like that. 200 years to say the least so why should i care about them?",votr9f

"I‚Äôve said this at least twice on Reddit. It exhausts me. Reading about people who celebrate the graphic deaths of fellow humans is repulsive. And it‚Äôs that exact base sentiment which is responsible for war in the first place. I‚Äôve said it before and I‚Äôll say it again: there are few things scarier than a man who thinks he is right. A man who truly thinks he is right can do no wrong in his pursuits for justice. 

Judge not a man in peace. Judge him when he has a score to rightfully settle. Death is not something to be celebrated. The death of Russian soldiers is not something to be celebrated.

It takes fervent empathy to realize that asking for someone you don‚Äôt know to defect for moral reasons is unfair. The way I ask others to think about it is this: 

If you were alive in Nazi Germany, what would you do? When asked this question, the vast majority of people say that they would hide Jews, and at least in some small way, resist Nazis and Nazism. Yet we *know* from history that *can‚Äôt be true.* Statistically speaking, those acts of heroism were *extremely* rare. This means that you likely would have been sympathetic to Nazi ideology, or at the very least, neutral in regard to the Nazi party. The Nazis had *massive public support.*

The point is, regardless of your convictions while sitting behind a keyboard- *that Russian soldier could have been you.* Are you actually celebrating the death of another human simply because you happened to be born in a place which conditioned you on a different way? Remember: If you were alive and of fighting age in Nazi Germany, you likely would have been a Nazi.

War is a sad tale with no winners. At least not of those who actually fight them. Only survivors. Remember that.

Blessings to Ukraine.",votr9f
"Completely agree and it's putting me off this sub.

So far I think all the content discussed in this post has been valid, even the man grieving his daughter. For me, it's important for some people to see.

My issue, and it's a big one, is the glorification and celebration of gore and morbidity.

Being cheerful that Ukraine is winning a battle is natural and I support it fully. Making a glorifying comment about suicide, is a demonstration of the lowest form of society we have; and ironically similar to many Russian attitudes. 

I would like to see this as a place to share information and knowledge. Not as the new BestGore with karma farming and most disgusting individuals of modern society.

Sorry for the rant",votr9f
"Ugh the rest of my comment is a mess lol, sorry, I'm really bad at putting my thoughts into words. But tl;dr - people are behind a keyboard/anonymous and emotional and they see others doing it. A lot don't understand the difference between being glad a threat is gone vs gloating/celebrating a death and mocking the dead. A lot agree with you (myself included) that a lot of comments are in poor taste and rather concerning with how desensitized and okay people are with saying those kinds of things. Anything you say, though, you're not going to change their opinions or behavior, especially over text. All that with happen is people will attack you rather than discuss morals.

I think a lot of people don't see the difference between being glad someone is dead vs actively reveling in someone's death. There's also the fact that they're behind keyboards and it's a lot harder to grasp that a human life has been lost.

From Ukraine's point of view, they're acting in self defense. If I kill someone who broke into my house with the intent to hurt me, I would be happy that I was safe and that the threat was find, and I don't think there's anything wrong with that. If I or people unrelated to the break in took extra time to *celebrate* it, I've said from the beginning that that's in very poor taste.

For Ukrainians, I can understand dehumanizing the enemy, and I feel awful for all of them, because they're going to be dealing with some serious trauma later on. I think for them (the ones actively fighting), it's kind of necessary to. For people on reddit safe in their homes, I think a lot of people are only thinking with their emotions that they can express anonymously. Emotions are running high, though, so if you point out to someone that one, it's in poor taste to actively make fun of someone who died a terrible death (or anyone really), and two, that there's no proof the soldier in the picture had committed war crimes or was doing anything other than trying to survive (I kinda feel like telling a Russian soldier to just up and leave their country completely with literally no plan or resources is similar to telling a victim in an abusive relationship to just leave... it's a lot harder than people are making it sound). There is a high number of soldiers now raping and stealing, but out of all the tens or hundreds of thousands of soldiers, I'd be willing to bet that not even half are rapists. To clarify - even one soldier being a rapist is absolutely terrible, but I don't think it's right to just label the entire army as war criminals. Every single country with a military involved in a war (except maybe the small ones) has had soldiers commit horrible war crimes and rape civilians. Anyway, that sentence got super off track, but if you point that out, you're going to be met with a lot of backlash - people are emotional and don't like to consider that their behavior of mocking the dead is concerning.

I think it also makes it easier for people to acknowledge the horrors that Putin is causing if they have in their head that none of the Russians are human, because war is inhumane and it's hard to grasp that a human could do the things that make the news.

People also don't like to think about how they are also influenced by propaganda of calling every Russian soldier a child rapist and every Russian citizen a supporter of child rape and murder. Generalizations are easy to make. And people can justify anything to themselves.

Maybe the people aren't pretending to be badass, maybe it's what they really think and the anonymity provided by the internet and a pseudonymous username allows them to express what would otherwise be a socially unacceptable opinion?",votr9f
"Eh as far as soldiers are concerned I don't feel bad about them. Russia is using professional soldiers in Ukraine, not conscripts. They knew the risks.

I do find it disturbing how some people here literally call for the genocide of the Russian people though",votr9f
"I faced Russia during the Cold War and it doesn't bother me to see one without a head. Besides, I've been browsing Reddit alot so my moral compass needs degaussing.",votr9f
"Nooo, ruzzian soldiers can get fucked. They deserve no humility.
They are shooting rockets at shopping centres you want fucking humility?",votr9f
"I understand well many are angry about what is happening in Ukraine now and sometimes feel that they have to take revenge and take some ugly pictures of dead Russian soldiers but if you really think it is so  pity for the Russian conscripts or ordinary soldiers then it is Russia's own civilian population that must do something and not just war activists  
one I know is in ukraine now and is fighting with the legion and the stories he comes up with what he sees with his own eyes is incomprehensible and nothing anyone wants and see neither for his enemy nor friend russian ancestor who is hung up in electricity poles  hung as a totem pole heads being separated from the body and put on fences just to show how brutal and scared one should be to attack them",votr9f
"This isn‚Äôt about hate and revenge.  It‚Äôs about what will end this pointless slaughter. Every Russian soldier who does inside the borders of Ukraine brings this war closer to it‚Äôs conclusion.  That is how this attrition thing works. Doesn‚Äôt matter if they die by bullets, bombs, or the blues‚Ä¶ the faster they die the sooner it ends. That is the sad math of this equation.",votr9f
"Russia has Siberia with acres of unexplored land and likely enormous oil reserves. If they keep finding mammoths it means there is oil. They don't need oil from Ukraine. Ukraine needs it more. Ukraine has something else they want. Black earth. Unbelievably fertile earth where anything can grow. There is a reason why in previous centuries Ukraine was called Bread Basket of the world. Also location location location. Access to Black sea. Access to Azov Sea, mountain region that is like Switzerland. And it's in Europe. In fact it is the largest European country",votr9f
"I saw the same picture and I didn't care for it.  We have no context for that though so it may have been killing himself to cease having to do the unthinkable or to cowardly avoid capture (like Hitler).  I find judging people who have been through hell (let's see how loving and accepting you are after being raped, losing a child and other family and knowing you'll lose more....all FOR NO REASON) to be more revolting than those who took the picture.  Now we safe westerners enjoying the suffering is also unseemly.  But it leans towards shadenfreude.  This is the deserved retribution towards the aggressor even if some individuals may have some ambivalence towards doing so.  Russia is not stopping people from leaving the country. If you kill you kill by choice. I know it'd be tough to leave and people invariably talk of retribution towards loved ones.  Sorry...but a Russian conscript can tell their family they're leaving.  Tell them to report you supposedly went on vacation to (name a spot in Russia) and head towards another country. Tell them after a week or two to report you missing. I wish Western countries would offer some sort of restricted visa to such people (we are already if you have a Master's or Doctoral degree but obviously most of the soldiers do not).  The atrocities committed against Ukrainians by an invading force (on behalf of a petty dictator afraid for his own useless life) are exponentially worse than anything done to that invading force.  Period.  And your preaching of the evils of gloating is worse than the gloating.  I approve of neither.  I will, however, judge your judging.  You can choose to not look and be distressed and donate only to relief work.  You do NOT get to even try to make equivalencies between what Russians have done and what Ukrainians have done.  It even raises the question of whether you're trying to divide those opposed to this naked unjustified aggression or just some idiot who thinks singing kumbayya will fix things.  Find another cause and spend some energy on it.  There are people in need all around us all.",votr9f
"When you are on the field, you are part of the orcs. 
The russian is invading. No empathy nor kindness should be giving to them when they are in Ukraine soil/with arms.
I think you are a hypocrite. I'd like to see more orcs in unrecognisable form. West should sending more heavy weapons/artillery/long range missile to aid Ukraine.
If Ukraine can do offensive earlier, less death to both side. It is a win-win.
Kindness and empathy should only be given to kind people. Not invaders/rapers/orcs.

Empathy and humanity are the common values of civilized world. Russia is clearly not one of the civilized society. Why bother to show mercy / empathy to them?

You are just a fucking hypocrite living in a peaceful, civilized and safe world 

Death to the enemy. Fuck russian. Slava Ukraini. 

All animals are equal but some are more equal than others. In this war, russians on Ukraine soil should be treated equally as other humans.",votr9f
"The war is bringing unspeakable evils to a country that did nothing to deserve such action -- and indeed has made incredible progress towards better governance, etc.  Given that you cannot arrest the Russian army, the only way to stop it -- and to bring the most good to the most people -- is to kill the members of the invading Russian army.  Killing them in large enough numbers will either force a retreat or enable a Ukrainian advance by maneuver.  (I would have said that the best way is to remove Putin, but that is simply not realistic and could bring about a nuclear war.)  

I do not hold the war against those Russians killed on the battlefield, but I sure as hell hope that Ukraine kills enough of them to force a withdrawal.  Realistically, this is the only way to end the butchery of the truly innocent.  The soldiers may be innocent in a sense, but the dead Ukrainian babies and civilians and the wrecked cities are the victims here.  Let's keep this in perspective, awful as it is.",votr9f
Anyone got a link to the post that OP referenced of the Russian that took himself out?,votr9f
"yea i am not going to sympathize with a bunch of rapists, murderers, animal abusers, terrorists, child murderers and child rapists. i will literally in anyway refuse to show these ""people"" even the bare minimum of humanity. let them die. let them commit suicide. let them burn alive. let their last moments of life be filled the agony they caused to actual innocent people. because when those Russians die the world is better of and you know it.

"You have good humanitarian thoughts. So, how do you recommend that good humanitarian people like you, spread the word that the russian army, ordered by putin but quite gung-ho for the rape and cowardly murdering, is conducting massive war crimes in Ukraine? I would offer that shocking pics like you describe might just make russians take a good look at the masters' orders they follow so blindly in the name of that nation's particularly depraved form of nationalism.",votr9f
"Unfortunately during a war many get dragged in, some of who have no ties to the war or the politics behind it.  Here are my 2 cents on the matter:

1. Russians -  Some are made to join the army, whilst some are spring swastikas on their chest and hoping to take out anyone not with an Russian passport. One Russian was made to join the army, whilst the other wants to destroy anything that is not pro Russia.  They are not the same people.
2. Ukranians - Ukraine has been fighting for its independence for years.  It is a burden and a hassle to always live in fear or being attacked, of fighting being going on since 2014. It also takes massive balls and guts to pick up army with no experience and say ...till death for our country. Ukraine is being forced into another war by russia, and I am hoping this will be the last one.

My bottom line: 

&#x200B;

Defenders - Heroes fighting for sovereignty, peace, land, freedom and a right to live in your born land.

Occupiers - They are shit yes, but let us not forget that not all people are bad.  Some are forced to do bad shit or else they get beaten into submission or executed.  Some do bad shit willingly 

Btw, I like this post OP.",votr9f
"And one things. Not every russian soldier is a ""nazi."" They could just be your local friendly CS:GO  playing dimitri who was probably tricked into the war by being told its just a ""training mission""

Sure, some soldiers have been caught with very questionable tattoos. but so have ukrainians... if russians have nazi tattoos and we call them nazis then why cant we call ukrainian soldiers nazis?",votr9f
I completely agree with you. I've seen too many people dehumanizing Russians in this sub. I'm surprised you didn't get downvote-bombed,votr9f
I have to say i agree with the commenter. This is not right. I do not understand the need to see these pictures now. In the beginning for shock value but imagine what a gift it is to Russian propaganda it is to see 'Civilized' Westerners gloating and making comments over their dead. Its surrendering the moral high ground and the opposite of what we are supposed to believe in. Before anyone gets on my case check my history.,votr9f
Couldn‚Äôt agree more.,votr9f
I AGREE MAN. LET'S MAKE A DIFFERENCE WITH THEY. BE HUMAN.,votr9f
"It‚Äôs these yanks man, they‚Äôre very emotional",votr9f
Any life lost in tragic ways such as this is a smear on humanity. Who are we to judge the circumstances behind said example? Perhaps his family are under threat or perhaps he seen the atrocious conduct of his side and couldn't deal with the disparity between that and the propaganda?,votr9f
Well said OP!,votr9f
"The responses here will be indicative of the loss of true humanity throughout all civilization. Your point is accurate, but Reddit will show you that people have been propagandized to hate and dehumanize.",votr9f
"Im just happy conflict is happening at all, though i am upset its not involving the nations i dislike. 
What you fail to realize is just how human this conflict is, it is pure extacy.",votr9f
"That particular soldier was another victim of a brutal regime - and a brainwashed population. Whereas I agree with the people who say one more invader dead is less dead Ukrainians - my heart goes out to the poor man and all others  who saw no other way out. As I commented in the original post, my condolences to his family and at the very least he is at peace now. It‚Äôs just a tragedy and a failure of humanity that he saw no other way out",votr9f
"‚ÄúRussian denazifes himself‚Äù is not from this war. It is a really old photo from another war/situation, it is not related to this conflict. Do a reverse image search on it. 


However, this behaviour is normal. It‚Äôs just like any other war. Notable is ww2 where German soldiers were dehumanised. They never survived in most camps (Canada was a safe haven for them) , namely Russian camps, even despite many never rooted for hitler but they had no other options to go to war yet their voices were not exactly heard or believed. Lots to unpack there.

In war people lose their humanity, one side with a few who commits  vile war crimes and all the blame is placed on the rest. Hate spreads like wildfire. Everyone is now the bad guy, everyone should die because one of their own murdered civilians. That‚Äôs the mindset most have. Now there‚Äôs assumptions and fingers pointed at every single one of the Russian soldiers. Human beings can be the most scariest when it comes to chaos, bloodshed, and crime. It can definitely bring out some hidden things that lurk in a humans mind. The way some Ukraine supporters  get excited over a dead Russian soldier whom we know no backstory of is disturbing. One less Russian soldier doesn‚Äôt just mean a Ukrainian person can be safe, it also means more Russians have to die in a senseless war. I can‚Äôt be happy of it. One lives but multiple die from the hands of a madman.",votr9f
"I fully agree with you, a lot of people seem to forget the fact that even the Russian soldiers are victims of Putins war. Many of them were either conscripted or joined because of years of propoganda. 

In war there are no winners only losers",votr9f
[deleted],votr9f
"Without humanity we are lost, just like Putin and his criminal cabal who have so callously exploited their own people to stay in power and make more money from them. Conscripts come from less affluent families and regions. The richer ones dodge the draft in the same way that we saw in VietNam, which had consequences for the Americans for decades afterwards. As a veteran myself I cannot condone the warcrimes and lack of disclipine and corrupt leadership we have seen. However, it‚Äôs worth pointing out that there are brave Russians who have a moral compass and are fighting for the Ukrainian side.",votr9f
Absolutely agree with you. I myself try to be civil and not look or enjoy the vices that's spread around.,votr9f
"I don't speak for anyone but myself, but I don't celebrate pictures of dead people or dance on their graves, regardless of who they are or how they died. I do, however, try to make an effort to look at as many of those pictures as I can. It isn't because I like them, but because I want to keep reminding myself what is going on every single day in this war. It isn't pretty, it isn't fair, and for every dead body we see I'm sure there are a dozen more that we don't. I look at these things to remind myself of the cost of achieving goals through war.",votr9f
this entire subreddit is just an echo chamber of in-humanity‚Ä¶,votr9f
"Perhaps some people make light of it and joke about it because internally they are horrified by it, because they have never had to process what it mean to have to kill another or to see friends and loved ones killed before your eyes. I'm a veteran and I used to joke and make light of similar things because we were a tight group and to show sympathy or human feelings at a time when feelings could get you killed (or worse your mates) could make you seem weak in the eyes of your mates. It wasn't until later that those thoughts and memories would take a toll on you. I can't speak for anyone else but sometimes black humour is all that keeps you from losing your shit. In the end we all lose if we lose sight of our humanity.",votr9f
"I'm tired of bullies. In the US, Russia, and in other countries from the highest leadership on down to the foot soldiers and frankly don't care and am happy to see when they get what's coming to them.",votr9f
"I agree. I stopped caring about this sub after the countless videos of dead Russian soldiers with uplifting funky music in the background, as if war is funny and everyone is having the time of their lives over there.",votr9f
"I don‚Äôt think the people here realize how much they share in common with the Russian invaders. Neither is capable of viewing the other as human. The invaders view the Ukie‚Äôs as Nazis and the Ukie‚Äôs view the invaders as Nazis.

Neither group seems capable of viewing this through the lens of a compassionate human being.

I know it is hard to treat invaders as human, but have some compassion. The whole ‚Äúnothing to see here, just a dead Russian‚Äù thing is ridiculous. How can you criticize the Russians for posting on social media that all Ukrainians should be raped and killed when Ukrainian supporters are saying the same type of stuff about Russians?

It would be nice if the Ukranians could win this war by reminding the Russians that they are Slavic brothers and sisters.

Unity is the way forward. Show the Russian invaders that they have nothing to avenge or fight for. This is how many Russians felt at the beginning of the war, which is why so many deserted.",votr9f
"You are not wrong. I thought the same thing when I saw that picture. In the grand scheme of things, people will pick a side. Whether or not a Russian soldier wants to be there or not, they made decisions in life.  The wrong ones. They could have defected and become a pow. There is very well documented evidence that Ukraine has treated pow fairly well. Unfortunately war doesn‚Äôt celebrate the individual‚Äôs thoughts or dreams.  So any loss of life is sad. But I can‚Äôt really have sympathy for them as a whole but on an individual level. Family, friends, a lifetime of thoughts and memories and ideas, some possibly being genius ideas‚Ä¶gone. But as a whole, Russia and their culture has been one of propaganda that they are strong tigers. That they are not to be messed with. Then they invade a land that is not theirs. As an American looking from afar, you can‚Äôt tell me they didn‚Äôt think they would invade and that this was just a ‚Äútraining exercise‚Äù when they mobilized and began surrounding Ukraine. I knew this was war the minute NPR said ‚ÄúRussian troops have amassed at the Ukrainians border and are saying it‚Äôs a large training exercise‚Äù. I can‚Äôt believe anyone believed that. Anyhow, there were plenty of signs that it was time not to be a team but think as an individual.  And they didn‚Äôt. I think it‚Äôs scarier to follow orders than it is to defect in this situation. Even if I defected and was imprisoned and murdered by my own people as a ‚Äútraitor‚Äù, at least I didn‚Äôt kill a bunch of innocents for no reason at all, only to dispatch myself like a coward when it was evident the war is lost.  One of Ukraine‚Äôs biggest tools is propaganda as well. So when you see a video from them showing a rotting Russian corpse and talking about dead Orcs or making light of the situation, consider it marketing. They want to wage psychological warfare. ‚ÄúDead orc brigade‚Äù does their thing, the press does their thing, and in the end it may deter the Russian people more from the support of their government. They are wonderful at marketing.  Selling missile engravings and making slick videos from the front line. That kind of stuff is probably good for their morale too.  War shouldn‚Äôt be fun but there‚Äôs no reason they can‚Äôt have a laugh despite it all.",votr9f

It's almost a troll post.  Nukes for a nuke is a world ender.  We need to wipe them out the old fashioned way if they dare try it.,y2u5mi
"Of course. NATO said it a thousand times already: If Russia does that, they will *conventionally* delete the Russian forces in Ukraine, Crimeea and the Black Sea.

Answering a nuke with a nuke would lead to the world's end in about a week.",y2u5mi
"The US has this same stance. A tactical nuke will pull our airforce and navy into the fight, officially. Obliteration of everything Russian in Ukraine (Crimea included) would be complete within days.",y2u5mi
"Make sense, if I am not mistaken European countries don't have a great number of tactical nukes and the majority of them are part of the nuclear sharing with the US.",y2u5mi
Russia using Nukes in Ukraine is like pissing in the wind. It will all just blow back on them.,y2u5mi
"Everyone marvels at HIMARS - one tactical nuke and you will see the fun from F15‚Äôs - F35‚Äôs - F22‚Äôs - F16‚Äôs - B1‚Äòs - B2‚Äôs - B52‚Äôs - US cruise missiles - and assorted other toys in the US arsenal. Go ahead Vlad - make my day‚Ä¶

oh I forgot‚Ä¶your Kerch bridge will be parked next to the Moscow in the first hour",y2u5mi
"This is no different to what the US has said. NATO doesn't need nukes to crush the Russian military in Ukraine. However, if Russia was to use a second nuke against NATO forces, all bets are off.",y2u5mi
"i guess that you have the geopolitical knowlegde of a 4th grader ?
Using nukes against nukes is ww3 aka the end of our civilisation
the occidental doctrine are that nukes are only used as a retaliation of attack on its own territory... Nukes are not toys",y2u5mi
Imagine not understanding the article and suggesting France is surrendering.,y2u5mi
That's just dumb to say. Even if France won't use nukes due to its doctrine he just should have been ambiguous.. Maybe we will nuke the shit out of Moscow  maybe not.,y2u5mi
Talk about showing your hand before its played,y2u5mi
He could've kept that to himself,y2u5mi
"Hopefully when ruSSia is in pieces after Ukraine break them, all the Countries with nukes can get rid of 99% of them.",y2u5mi
"Eventually NATO will come out with a joint statement basic lay saying that if a nuclear weapon is used in Ukraine, NATO nuclear weapons will not be deployed.

The scope of whatever operations would be conducted in reply, would be announced and likely limited to Ukraine only. Retired US generals pretty much stated what would be appropriate if Russia uses a nuclear weapon:

1) the destruction of Russian forces inside of Ukraine as is recognized by the international community
2) the black sea fleet would be sunk

This is just talk that eventually will form into NATOs official policy on a what if scenario in a attempt to limit this conflict from spreading.",y2u5mi
I‚Äôm frankly surprised the French haven‚Äôt surrendered already,y2u5mi
Marcon has a fetish for Putins table‚Ä¶,y2u5mi
He is probably concerned about humiliating Putin,y2u5mi
"It would have been better to be ambiguous and not talk about it, but sadly macron ignored his own advice! His statement will embolden Putin",y2u5mi
"Emmanuel ""Let's not humiliate Putin"" Macron.",y2u5mi
Of course France won't do anything.  All they have to do is stand there and look tough because they know their boy America is already dragging knuckles from across the bar,y2u5mi
"ag France, russia isnt interested in you, stop stitching those white flags and you dont have to sign those surrender forms!!",y2u5mi
"I think they should make different statements to make it more unpredictable for Russia. 

France will ‚Äúdelete‚Äù everything Russia has in Ukraine and the other can retaliate with nukes into Russia. I think that might even be worse for Russia.",y2u5mi
Well why not,y2u5mi
He didn‚Äôt even have to say that but since he did its like hes giving putin permission to. Smh,y2u5mi
"I recall US, British and France all agreed to protect Ukraine from nukes in one treaty when Ukraine gave up their nukes? No?",y2u5mi
That could be a good thing without Macron's finger on the button!,y2u5mi
So France it's already surrendering üòÜ a nuclear war hasn't even started they say history repeats itself and its true.,y2u5mi
Nope but be sure to make men into woman,y2u5mi
"Nobody gives a fuck if you do or not, Macron. The heavy lifters of the west will take care of business, if it ever becomes necessary. God forbid. But thanks for showing Putin that your resolve is weak, and your support of Ukraine is limited and conditional. Good job of wiffle-waffling, froggie.",y2u5mi
Fucking stupid,y2u5mi
To be fair when nuclear war is on the table nobody says oh no FranceüòÇ it‚Äôs all Russia and the USA,y2u5mi

"Let us not laugh about this guy.  Poeple are being forced to join the army in Russia and the Doneskt regions with no choice.

"As much as I'm thick-skinned when it comes to invader gore, even if they get blasted while doing everyday shit instead of warcrimes, this guy might actually not deserve getting pointed and laughed at.

There is a chance he might have simply been an ordinary orc who offed himself due to fearing defeat or capture. Or maybe he done some shit so horrid, he finally got caught up by guilt.  
But that also might have been a good man who didn't want to be there and participate in murder, but saw no way out other than removing himself from this world. Or a simple troop who enlisted thinking he'll do a glorious, chivalrous job, but seeing all this shit made him go mad and eventually snap rather than accept reality. Or maybe even a conscript who got abused by his brave ""comrades"" and superiors, after all it seems like that's one of the few things orcs excel at. And those three options are actually tragic.",vo6gss
That war will create tens of thousands of soldiers with PTSD just as the Iraq/Afghanistan wars did.  This is only the beginning for the Russians and Ukrainians on what they will have to deal with when that mess finally ends.  The US averages 22 soldier suicides a day.  More US soldiers have died of suicide that were lost in combat.  The Russians and Ukrainians will now have to deal with the same horrible issue of Soldier suicides.,vo6gss

Alot of people sensitive to reality of the world and war. If more people actually knew and saw what real carnage is maybe some will have a change of heart. These kids need to realize that reality is not video game or action movie. More people need to see the real horrors or war. You know he did not want to be there,vo6gss

My condolences to his family. Another victim of Russias tyranny,vo6gss
What does that mean? He shot himself?,vo6gss
Makes me wanna think. Is he just one of those good characters who are just following orders that are wrong in all aspects?,vo6gss

This is what Putler should do in his bunker.,vo6gss
"I won't make fun of him, but let's also not hail him as a brave self-sacrifising hero who preferred to put himself out rather than slaughter people for the same reason that we don't  know who he is and what he's done. He might have been a forced recruit who wanted to ""end the cycle"", sure, but he might also have been a rapist murderer who volunteered himself and once saw the state of the Russian army and lost hope, decided to off himself.
So ok, I won't be an asshole about him, but I'm also not going to join the uwu bandwagon.",vo6gss
That‚Äôs one way to get discharged from the army,vo6gss

this is just sad.,vo6gss
Anyone know what regiment this is also? Sad really as he‚Äôs human and not all of them agree to the war!,vo6gss
Poor fucker probably didn't want to be there in the first place.,vo6gss
The kinds of photos that should be air dropped over red square,vo6gss
"Honestly, this caption is pretty disgusting. We don‚Äôt know anything about that man. He could have been forced into the military, abused in countless ways and then forced to murder people in a country that has done him no wrong. Maybe all of it was too much to take? Either way, it‚Äôs important not to lose your humanity. That‚Äôs still somebody‚Äôs son. I don‚Äôt back the Russians even by one 10th of a percentage but that‚Äôs still a gross title, OP.",vo6gss
Solider that off himself because he does not want to kill civilians has my respect,vo6gss

Poor man... Go fk yourself OP,vo6gss
Nobody knows why this guy killed himself. Its naive to assume he killed himself because he didnt want to fight this war. He may have been in a losing battle and decided suicide was better than surrender. His unit might have committed terrible attrocities and when they were about to be captured he figured he would be tortured and shot anyway for his crimes.,vo6gss
Loading‚Ä¶ insensitive russian hate comments,vo6gss
hey op youre a fucking asshole for no NSFW tag,vo6gss
You are a pile of shit for laughing at that. War hurt both side and not every Russian is there by pleasure. You are the one calling them orc While acting like them.,vo6gss
"This war made me realize that people are just as primitive as ever, and still have an ""Us against them"" mentality.   


Russian soldier = demon

Ukrainian soldier = angel

PTSD already hit hard he was probably forced to do things that haunted him,vo6gss
That‚Äôs really fucking sad,vo6gss
As fucked up as the war in Ukraine is I think it's kind of disgusting that we are all sitting back making fun of dead human beings. Twist it up any which way you'd like but none of it is right.,vo6gss

That‚Äôs actually really sad. If he killed himself he was clearly in a state of some distress.,vo6gss

Sad he didn't realize there was a way out. Surrender. Join the Russian Legion.,vo6gss

Poor kid sheesh,vo6gss
Sad,vo6gss
Fuck Putin!,vo6gss
"War is fucked. Putin will destroy a whole generation of Russians, but with the way they have acted, it's hard for me to emphasize with them. How could a country in Europe still be this fucked?",vo6gss

Terrible.  Maybe there is hope in all of this that Putin will not survive and MAYBE Russia could join the free world one day and to use its resources to better its people‚Äôs lives.  Such a waste.,vo6gss
it‚Äôs all Putin‚Äôs fault. death to Putin.,vo6gss
Fk..Just kill Z Generals or Oficers . Why to waste you life..:( so sad .,vo6gss

Dehumanizing is never ok. He died for no glory only for the lesser of too evils.,vo6gss
"This guy killed himself to NOT participate or be a part of something so horrible. Essentially a martyr, and there‚Äôs probably a lot more like him who are good people, happy kids who are forced into this environment. RIP",vo6gss
I wish these kinds of images would pixelate rather than just appear above and below my regular feed of cat / dank memes.,vo6gss
Suicide is common during war. Even in basic training guys were trying to kill themselves.,vo6gss
"As much as the world disagrees with the war and Russia‚Äôs actions, with a handful of them commuting the worst crimes, we need to remember they are human too and they do have a proportion that do not want to be there. So as much as I like to see the end of the invasion, this is sad. üò¢ üá∫üá¶",vo6gss

Jeez this is actually just really sad. That's all I can say. Please no more scenes like this OP.,vo6gss
"Could be normal depression. The odds are that he could not take the bullying and hardships of the RFA. Or I would like to think he woke up and realized; My God these people I'm with are orcs and I'm not. There's no way out. Maybe he saw something or went along with something that tormented the mind of a gentle soul. 

For me, if I think he did this out of cowardice then he becomes just another symbol of Russian national mental illness. If I think of him as a poor soul, it gives me some hope in humanity and the future humanity of Russians once they awaken. If they ever do.

Since I'll most likely never know, I'm gonna take the high road and wish him peace on his journey and hope this is an end to his torments.",vo6gss
Maybe he just got a dear John letter and Dimitri is boning his girlfriend and he said fuck it all...,vo6gss

"I've been thinking a lot about these conscripts. 
The shit they got roped into.
Even the murder, rape and torture.
They wouldn't have done that stuff otherwise.

I heard this call from a Russian kid to his mother.
He told her about torturing captives.
She encouraged him about it.
But he said one thing that hit me. I heard his voice and read the translation. 
""Mama, I was a good boy.""
Part of him missed the naif who had never hurt anyone like that before.
That good boy is dead and he won't come back home. This new creature is who might go home.
Or maybe this was him.",vo6gss
This is what war does to people psychologically. It's bad for the victims and it's also bad for the perpetrators. War is just bad. There's nothing good about it.,vo6gss
He‚Äôs going to have a hell of a headache when he wakes up,vo6gss
Havent been on reddit in weeks and this is the first thing i see O.o,vo6gss
"This wording of yours really wakes negative emotions deep down from me. Not because you don't like Russians, but rather how much of an animal you need to be to joke on somebody who comitted suicide. Then again, expecting a person like you to think critically is like asking a mutt to write Shakespeare.

I just hope you find help, so you don't say something like that to anyone again, of any nationality.",vo6gss
"Imagine being conscripted and forced into a war you don‚Äôt want to fight, hundreds of miles away from your home and family, with no end in sight. Everyone hates you, but you‚Äôre just a regular dude who wanted to stay home and play Minecraft and you really miss you moms cooking. I‚Äôd fucking shoot myself too",vo6gss
"Ok, maybe. I am reading everything from ""He deserved it"", ""How sad it must be for him"" ""He got cornered by Ukrainians and killed himself to avoid capture"", ""He killed himself because he didn't want to take part in Putin's nightmare"", ""He's a hero"", etc... etc.. etc... However, has anyone considered that this is a staged event? Perhaps he was killed by a conscript who didn't want to follow orders, or a Ukrainian sympathizers within their ranks? Maybe a disgruntled Russian orc that wanted to settle a score with this guy over something unrelated? If he killed himself, forensics would show a pattern of blood splatter behind his head and all over the wall. That's a high powered rifle he shot himself with. Such a jolt would not likely leave him sitting up in his position and maintaining his thumb on the trigger. What's more, the blood splatter should be almost directly behind his head because that is a long rifle and you would not be pointing it directly upwards if you are sitting down. You would have to hold it out in front of you and point it more towards the back. This guy might have been killed elsewhere and then staged right there. If that is blood behind him and above him.. then that is inconsistent with him committing suicide with such a large caliber long rifle. It shouldn't be so high up with virtually no blood behind him.",vo6gss
It is in bad taste to parade such a desperate person here and to make fun of his apparently hopeless situation! Shame on you!,vo6gss
This is sad,vo6gss
"Fuck - how is there so much greed, misery, and hate in this world. Juxtaposing this with the image of that poor little girl - whose house was hit by artillery just a few days ago - who died in her bed, asleep. Like, they laid in their bed and closed their eyes with  what I can only hope was some semblance of safety/comfort/warmth despite the chaos ‚Äî‚Äî while this guy, crawled down into what looks like the last place a human could find safety/comfort/warmth. I like to think that it would be over quickly, but the moments between the weight of his thumb pushing the trigger - waiting for the resistance to slowly ease for the pin to hit the cap - must‚Äôve felt like forever.",vo6gss
May he rest easy‚Ä¶,vo6gss
"I don‚Äôt know the intent of his suicide, maybe he was encircled and felt he was to be killed anyways and decided to do it himself OR he was truly forced into this war and it took its toll. If the latter, I certainly feel for this man, otherwise‚Ä¶. Meh",vo6gss

I don't hold ill will towards him or celebrate his death.

Maybe he chose that rather than doing a war crime. 

Maybe he chose that because he couldn't live with a war crime he had done, and just wanted forgiveness. 

Maybe he was just forced into some fucked up, hopeless shit and saw no other way out of this nightmare.

Regardless of who this guy is, I hope he finds some sort of peace and atonement on the other side. 

I really hope everyone like him will turn their guns on their officers and generals instead.",vo6gss

"I know they are the ""bad guys"" in this war. But I still find this really sad to see. The saddest part is his death will affect many people in his village but the people at the top don't even care. Hell, they'll probably won't even compensate his family saying he didn't die fighting but as of a result of his own action therefore he doesn't qualify",vo6gss

If citizens just stopped fighting for our overlords we could fight them back very easy. Actually it‚Äôs much easier to fight our overlords then it is to fight ourselves. It‚Äôs just a lot scarier is all. But it would maybe only last 3 months tops if everyone stopped working and take their money out of the banks then if everyone marched a few will die by the people who stayed to fight for their overlord but many would surrender and not fight if they see everyone fighting back.  This is the one thing they don‚Äôt want us to do and are terrified but we will reach there one day.  Just remember the new world order isn‚Äôt our government's coming together it‚Äôs the citizens coming together fighting off the governments.,vo6gss

"Nonsense, the police separate the two groups. this is standard in all demonstrations so that the two groups don't attack each other.

Nobody gets arrested in Austria just because they have a flag. (Unless it has a swastika on it, you will be taken to court for that)",umii7w

If you officially registered  a demonstration, Police will make sure that you can demonstrate peacefully. Even if you are demonstrating for a retarded fuck like Putin.

"There is a lot at stakes here for the Kremlin. They need to justify the war to their domestic audience which means they need to present them some Nazis, some scapegoats that are presentable.

">NATO and the US Will continue to sit by and watch Putin flatten Ukraine and exterminate their people

Ukraine is being funnelled an ENORMOUS amount of weapons  
Ukraine is being funnelled an ENORMOUS amount of money  
Ukraine is being funnelled an ENORMOUS amount of supplies and support  
Ukraine is getting access to Real-Time NATO intelligence.

If you think these these things count as ""sitting by and watching"" then you are trolling or blind.

NATO is a **DEFENSIVE** organisation... to attack would not only go against *everything* NATO stands for but also would 'prove' Putin and China right.  
It sucks that Russia has chosen Ukraine to bet the house on a pair of 5s but NATO countries are damaging their own economies to do as much as possible to help out, and for Democracies that is a far stronger call than most people imagine.

This is not about 'whataboutism' the invasion of Ukraine is being fought in the only way it can to ensure the world does not end up like these poor suffering Ukrainian cities. As it stands the Russians are struggling and a LOT of this is due to NATO support.

I can assure you that if you were to get your wish and NATO came in guns blazing there would be a lot less left of Ukraine than there is likely to be when the Russians are chased away with their tails between their legs. Ukraine will become a full unrestricted warfare battlefield, if nukes are used it will be in Ukraine first as a result and the outcome of that is not something ANYONE should take lightly",tandxr
"Not putting American or NATO boots on the ground in Ukraine does not = sitting by and watching Putin flatten them. They are doing a lot right now, both publicly and in ways we aren't going to hear about anytime soon due to security concerns, to support Ukraine. They can and should and hopefully will do lots more of that and in even better ways, as the war continues. And it's far from certain that Putin's army can win the war and conquer Ukraine, either. His army and air force have been taking heavy losses, and they can't keep that up forever. So, yeah... things are uncertain right now, but russia beating Ukraine is not a sure thing by any means.",tandxr
We‚Äôre going to keep fighting to the last Ukrainian.,tandxr
"Well IMO we've not yet seen the floodgates open regarding ""volunteers"" to fight for Ukraine.  Going back to 1936 it's a fact that over 35K from 52 countries went to Spain to fight the facists.  [https://www.history.com/news/spanish-civil-war-foreign-nationals-volunteer](https://www.history.com/news/spanish-civil-war-foreign-nationals-volunteer) The world population was less than 2.2B in 1936 and is now 7.9B.  Having fighters (boots on the ground) is one thing, though not enough.  I only hope and pray that that NATO chooses to be the arsenal of Democracy and freedom in this war and supplies all the weapons needed to defeat Russian aggression.",tandxr
"It's just basically what is called a ""Scorched Earth"" military strategy. Has been used many times before in the history of wars and conflicts.",tandxr
"NATO has been very clear since the beginning that they would not put boots on the ground. They are funneling massive amounts of funding, weapons, and intel to Ukraine. This is the most we have seen the world ever rally around one country who is at war‚Ä¶ at least in the history of modern war. The EU actually funded weapons, which is unheard of. 

I do think the US really sucked with what they did in regards to promising planes. I think they though Poland would never agree to it and they would look like the good guy. They didn‚Äôt expect Poland to find a work around by sending the planes to the US base in Germany. Either way, they never should have said they would do it if they didn‚Äôt plan to do it. They knew the risks when they said they would supply Poland if Poland supplied Ukraine. I know it is escalation but I feel like we are at that point and it isn‚Äôt quite the same as NATO getting involved outright. 

Also be rest assured that plenty of volunteers are coming. People care and are doing what they can. Ultimately people are afraid that Putin is insane enough (and the people behind him are insane enough or scared enough) to push that button to end the world. Nobody wants that‚Ä¶ those that may survive that nightmare scenario probably wouldn‚Äôt want to survive.",tandxr

its complicated,tandxr
Yikes.,tandxr
"Finland and other Baltic states need to be quickly incorporated into NATO. If Russia tries to do to them what they're doing to Ukraine, be it on their heads.",tandxr
"If Nato stood by, the Russians would already have taken Kiev. Nato countries have been doing the best they can shy of entering the war. They should be thankful they got those anti-tank and anti- aircraft weapons.",tandxr
"Putin is being played like a fiddle. The west lured him into this conflict, to cripple Russia in the long term. Unfortunately Ukraine is paying for it",tandxr

"Likely true.

Hate to break it to all those calling fake.

Mariupol defenders were split in 3. One of those being Ukrainian marines.

They have fought for 35 days of the 40 day war completely cut off.

They were completely surrounded and besieged.

The haven't had running water for weeks.

I wonder if that's the remains of 2 of the 3 groups or just 1.

Azov is definitely still going as if they get caught it's execution time as ""de-nazification"" and they are one of the 3 groups (they are the southern trapped group in the factory district).

It's been expected for Mariupol to fall over the next 3 days.

Sorry, but imagining them fighting with tooth and nail on no food, no water, no ammo is unrealistic.

These guys are heroes. They bought the north precious time over the past month and should be highly commended. This surrender is NOT a black mark on a single man's name there.

They should all carry their heads high.

Surrendering to the DPR was probably intentional and a condition as a last fuck you to Russia, not recognizing their victory. They lost the battle, but may be directly responsible for winning the war.

EDIT: THEY HAVE NOT SURRENDERED!!!

Right now Putin has 70% support in Russia, this will only change when they suffer, when they see the truth. Ukrainians are suffering right now, and unlike Russia, they had no choice.

FYI, even if Putin presses his big red button, there‚Äôs still a long line of humans that have to agree with him before things can fly. Which is *very* fucking unlikely as long as they aren‚Äôt being nuked themselves.

Putin can spatter about ‚Äúmuh nukes‚Äù all he wants without consequences. If he actually tries to use them that‚Äôs going to go very differently for him",tmrglp
If the state of the Russian military is anything to go by I would guess that a good number of their nukes are poorly maintained so even if the big red button is pressed it might do little to nothing at all,tmrglp

"So, let me help make you feel better.

I spent 20 years in as an Infantryman in US Military.  Now I run a channel on YouTube where I explain a lot of what is going on in Ukraine to civilians form a military standpoint.  I was actually going to do a video on this, but here is what I would say:

There are basically two kinds of nuclear war - tactical and strategic.

Strategic war goes after counterforce (your ability to fight) and countervalue (economic and population targets).

Tactical war goes after specific tactical targets.

There are no good tactical targets in Ukraine for nuclear weapons.  Normally you would use tactical nuclear weapons on enemy troop concentrations.   Ukraine is fighting a very asymmetric defensive war, so they really aren't massing their forces in an appreciable way that can be exploited by a nuclear strike.

However, if NATO entered the war, and Russia felt sufficiently threatened, tactical weapons could be used against prepositioned equipment sites in:

Brunssum, Netherlands  
Coevorden, Netherlands  
Eygelshoven Netherlands  
Vriezenveen, Netherlands  
Bettembourg, Luxembourg  
Sanem, Luxembourg  
Zutendaal, Belgium  
Bardufoss, Norway  
Camp Darby, Italy

These won't be large weapons.  Russia will want to minimize its use of weapons because every time they use a weapon, NATO gets a ""free one"" to use against them.  This will help prevent things from escalating.  

So unless you live near... and I mean very near these sites, you will be fine.  I doubt that Russia would move to counterforce/countervalue weapons over this.",tmrglp
You won't even know it happened.,tmrglp

"Honestly doubt it will happen. Putin is afraid of covid and he realizes Nukes would assure his destruction. Secondly the people in control of nukes have loved ones they care about and they don‚Äôt want to die either, time and time again during the Cold War nuclear warfare was averted because calm heads prevailed.

Let‚Äôs say, Failing that. Take solace in that nuclear warfare means we all die.",tmrglp
"I could joke like a Redditor, but if you wish to determine your risk of death if war starts you could look at Nuclear War Survival Skills by Kearny. It's an open source publication. You could also look at nuke map https://nuclearsecrecy.com/nukemap/. For yields of your adversary warheads, Wikipedia is probably close. Unless you are near missile silos or bunkers they will be airburst.  You will find that millions will die but also millions won't. The aftermath will be more like Ukraine now. So not great but still not zombies and mutants. So here's hoping you are not near a NATO or Russian military installation or a large city of US, Russia, UK or France. If so get yourself to a safe distance from the initial blast, save a few weeks of food and water and dig a covered hole you should be fine.",tmrglp

"I have read the article. 

I agree that the Pope has kept an ambiguous stance on Ukraine (but he is the pope, did you really expect him to say ""ruzzians bad, kill them freely, jesus wont mind""?), But the article at hand does not say anything about this and I think that correlating it to Ukraine is a bit of a stretch.

1. The pope dissolved the GOVERNMENT of the order, not the order itself, it is being reformed and a new government will be elected, the Knights of Malta are not going anywhere.

2. The article explicitly states that this attrition between the vatican and the Knights of Malta is old and the action was long in the working, it has nothing to do with the war in Ukraine.

3. The actual reasons provided by the vatican are clearly explained in the article and if one would see a conspiracy theory behind them it may be to reinforce the vatican control over the Knights of Malta and meddle in their sovereignty, not to interfere with Ukraine.

4. Ukraine is cited in the article in literally one line, as an up to date example of the type of humanitarian activity the Knights do, and as an explanation of why keeping  their ""sovereign"" status in international politics helps them in their activities. It is cited so that the reader can have some context about why the heck a knightly order exists in 2022, it never implies that the vatican dissolved the order (it did not) because of ukraine.",x5bgey
Context to Ukraine war?,x5bgey
"Vatican calls Russia the aggressors.

"After reading the article, it sounds like it's about time that he did so. 

If you want to go about calling yourself a Roman Catholic order, you must expect Vatican oversight and papal supremacy.  If you don't, the Anglicans would like to have a word with you over tea and cake.

The order itself was in a state of disunion over the election of its Grand Master.  The Old Guard wanted to ensure that the Grand Master had noble ancestry and serve for life.  The New Guard wanted to discard the requirement for noble ancestry and limit the service of the Grand Master.  A new Constitution was promulgated with the Pope's support:  no Euronobility requirement and two ten-year terms for the Grand Master, mandatory retirement at 85.  The former Grand Master had passed away, his deputy is now the Interim, and new elections will be held. 

So what happened was more of an operating system upgrade.  Maybe it will be for the good, maybe otherwise. 

And if the sort of carryings-on of these Knights in Nigeria are a hint, they needed to be taken down a peg.  Setting up such a ruckus that a nation's Bishop's Conference suspends you rarely goes well.

"Too late to be honest...

If he could get a flight in his name delivered to an airport he would still need to be allowed to fly somewhere like south Korea or a 3rd party country that still accepts flights to and from the two countries you wish them to travel.

One thing to note is that everyone is getting scanned for a long time on the borders out of Russia, I heard this from a Russian attempting to leave. They'll go through all your media accounts and check for anything they don't agree with to bot allow the person to leave. This means 2 flight tickets might be necessary because of these delays.

They‚Äôll simply lose those expensive bombers,v9uqag
"Because they have not managed to destroy Ukrainian anti-air defence.  High-flying strategic bombers over Ukrainian cities would be a turkey shoot for S300, Buk, Osa and other aa systems.",v9uqag
"russia doesn‚Äôt have air superiority in Ukraine. That‚Äôs why they use fast, low flying strike crafts with dumb munitions. They use strategic bombers to launch long range cruise missiles from inside their territory to avoid losing the planes",v9uqag
How will Russians rape Ukrainian children from fifty k feet?,v9uqag
they get shot down,v9uqag
Because Russia would lose all its strategic bombers.,v9uqag
How about Russia gets the fuck out of Ukrainian territory and stops killing and raping women and kids.,v9uqag
In other words: Russia and its army know it is shit.,v9uqag
"Carpet bombing is way misunderstood. It's not an approach likely to hit the target, indeed, in World War II, such blind bombing was highly inaccurate and it took dozens of bombers to destroy a single target. That's why people use precision weaponry  these days, one bomber can do 100x the work of an old bomber seventy years ago.",v9uqag
"I would expect about 40% of already small numbers of Russian bombers to be airworthy. Also accuracy of the bombing would be an issue as UA and RU forces on the ground are less than 1km away.
 But the most problematic would be UA airforce and air defence. As bombers they are pretty much sitting ducks without sufficient electronic warfare aircraft cover (RU doesn't have any). If you want to shoot down fighter SAM missiles have about 30% range compared to if they are shooting down bombers. This means even older and shorter range SAMs Like Kub or Thor and maybe even osa would be able to shoot them down easy.",v9uqag
Because of ukrainian air defence i presume. It would be a huge lost to even loose one of those bombers so they're not taking that risk. I assume.,v9uqag
for maybe the same reasons we haven't gone in and done that to Moscow and St Petersburg.,v9uqag
"Cause they not capable to do so.
They will lose them sooner than they can do even 5 percent of damage",v9uqag
i guess russia doesnt have enough bombs left,v9uqag
"Even if they had air superiority, you generally can‚Äôt win wars entirely from bombardment. And using dumb bombs against moving targets isn‚Äôt an option, so you can‚Äôt even win by attrition from the air like that either.",v9uqag
"I admit that I don't know much of which is going on, so I am asking you guys here.",v9uqag
They dont have the resources...corruption...someone sold the planes and bombs ;],v9uqag
"They could use strategic bombers, but they would have to be flying at an altitude of around 100-200 meters.",v9uqag
"Air superiority was not achieved in the early stages of the war.  If you do not get that at the start, you are at a disadvantage in my humble opinion.  Since they did not manage the air, 1 motivation starts to way down and of course the air combat will also suffer.

Russia knows it could never take over all Ukraine from the start, hence they gave up fighting for Kyiv, and moved its efforts to the Donbas region. 

Plus, the arms from all across the globe to Ukraine was an offense from the Ukrainian side that Russia did not forsee.",v9uqag
Because they can't hit jack shit.,v9uqag
It is impossible. A bomb does not destroy as much as people think. And there is a lot of ground to cover.,v9uqag
"On the flip side, why doesn‚Äôt Ukraine just ‚Äò carpet bomb ‚Äò all of the Russians positions ? ffs.",v9uqag
"Probably because Russian pilots would be going zippity zappity, BLYAT! now I go splatity!  


But on a serious note, Ukraine has been able to mostly control their skies well with western defense systems and Russia doesn't have that many competent pilots.",v9uqag
They haven‚Äôt destroyed the UAF and haven‚Äôt won air superiority. You‚Äôre an idiot.,v9uqag
They would if they could. They wanted this over in 2 days..,v9uqag
No air superiority.,v9uqag
They scared of the world if they destroy everything in Ukrainian,v9uqag
They would destroy all those washing machines by carpet bombing. What else will they have to show their wives mothers and girlfriends for their tike in Ukraine without pillage ? They will no doubt have to keep the rape secret but can keep the babooshkas happy with a stolen washer drier.,v9uqag
Because they don't have them or it would not help accomplish their goals,v9uqag
"Strategic bombers has a follow up implication - limited capacity. You can of course dedicate strategic bombers to any targets, but that would be a waste of a strategic asset. An outpost can be overcome with artillery, mechanized, armored, or dismounted troops. It can also move from one building to the next if it needs to. Your strategic bombing mission being defeated by switching buildings is a pretty realistic outcome.",v9uqag
"1. They don‚Äôt have enough bomb except the nukes.

2. They didn‚Äôt clear the Ukrainian sky. They are under threat of Ukrainian anti-air defense.",v9uqag
I‚Äôm starting to question whether u r orcssian or not. Where do these answers go after written here?,v9uqag
"Because they don't have that much capability neither technical nor qualified human resources. Ukraine is a big country, it's not like they could wipe out one or two cities and that's done

You seem overestimating russian capability and underestimating Ukraine",v9uqag
"To add on, WW2 style ‚Äústrategic bombing‚Äù involves dropping large amounts of unguided bombs ‚Äúsomewhere over there‚Äù and hoping you do enough damage. Only the Allies (generally the US) were able to conduct such large scale operations with the backing of a fully mobilised war industry

Modern artillery is far more useful, accurate, and cost effective",v9uqag
"Nato early warning would tell Ukraine when,where,how high,and how many.
Figure 1/3 would crash due to having critical components stolen.",v9uqag
"Anti Air? I've never seen ""strategic bombers"" capable of carpet bombing while flying at ground level. They already have a hard enough time carrying out surgical strikes with small aircrafts.",v9uqag
"All of the mentioned reasons are valid, however there is one more reason:

NATO Airspace.

The bombers would have to keep flying above Ukraine, making airstrikes a little bit more complicated. If they would enter NATO airspace, it could be considered a threat forcing an actual response.",v9uqag
"It's not strategically worth it. 
Why waste planes that will most likely be shot down with the help of U.S Intel and US made anti aircraft weapons. 

It's litterally impossible for russia to gain air superiority, its not the ukrainian airforce that's a problem it's the constant influx of anti aircraft weapons.",v9uqag
"you need precision guided bombs for that and supposedly they are out of them

&#x200B;

in WW2 the early missions had loss rates of 30% or so of B-17's. back then you could just replace the people and build new bombers. these days you can't replace bombers that fast and crew take many months to train",v9uqag
NATO AWACS would light them up before they crossed the border and some S300s would greet them,v9uqag
Because the favor would be returned;-),v9uqag
"Ukraine said that Russian TU-22M bombers dropped bombs on Mariupol and they have started to build up their FAB 500 bombs.

I suspect that any attempt to do a deep penetration of Ukrainian airspace would result in shot-down TU-22s.

I suspect the bomber crews consider a 1000 meter CEP good enough and they want to arrive on the approximate are, drop on the approximate target and get the hell out.",v9uqag
"Also Ukraine has rugs, no carpets.",v9uqag
"They likely also don't have the parts, fuel or pilots.  Plus Russia has had alot of bad weather in relation to their air superiority lately.  <Queue it's raining men>",v9uqag
Because the Ukrainian air defence forces are on point,v9uqag
"Russia largely keep their air missions well behind the front lines - as fly up and fire cruise missiles or super low altitude if near the front.  
Ukraine has significant anti-air capabilities and if you get near the front lines - you have to fly low enough that radar can't spot you.  
Also the bombers aren't the only planes at risk - you have to escort the bombers with fighters or else Ukraine is just going to send their fighters up to shoot them down. So now you have lots more planes at risk   
There is also the potential issue of jet fuel - bombers use a massive amount of fuel - Russia prior to the war limited the amount of flying its jet pilots were allowed to do to train. An unrestricted bombing campaign could possible run Russia out of het fuel. (Despite Russia being a oil supplier - jet fuel requires a very high quality grade of oil with lots of refinement - so just having lots of oil doesn't mean you can make a lot of jet fuel)   
High altitude carpet bombing is also not suited for hitting small specific targets, its for leveling cities. What Russia is doing now is horrifying enough but if Russia started carpet bombing the major Ukraine cities- you would see a lot of countries that don't want to provoke Russia by supplying certain equipment change their minds.   
Cruise missile attacks on population centers is bad, but carpet bombing population centers and leveling them like Mariupol is a horror at a whole different level.",v9uqag
that doesnt sound very liberating to me. And not to russians either.,v9uqag
"Russia has very limited supply of heavy bombs. According to Soviet doctrine strategic bombers carried either nulcear bombs and cruise or supersonic missiles, all of them very expensive and produced in limited numbers to attack strategic targets.

Another thing is Russia has only \~70 strategic bombers, among them only \~20 are moderately outdated non-stealth 1980s Tu-160, the rest are hopelessly outdated propeller driven Tu-95 extremally vunerable to interception with any kind of fighter or heavy SAM sytems. Only around 40% of Russian strategic bombers are estimated to be airworthy and combat ready.

To ""carpet bomb all Ukraine outposts"" they would need many hundreds of jet powered strategic bombers and nearly infinite amount of bombs. Still many bombers would be easily intercepted when deep inside enemy territory by most basic heavy SAM systems attacking many bombers at once when flying on easily predictable routes to the targets in tight formations.

In short - it has nothing to do with how modern warfare is being fought.",v9uqag
"Lack of sufficient strategic bombers (not enough planes to simultaneously hit multiple outposts in a carpet bombing campaign)

Lack of sufficient strategic *bombs* (carpet bombing uses a *lot* of bombs)

Lack of intel (Don't know where all the outposts are)

Lack of ability to suppress air defenses (strategic bombers on carpet bombing missions are *super* vulnerable to SAMs and enemy fighters)

Lack of precision (some Ukr strongpoints are highly hardened, similar to the Azov Steel mill and would require precise bombing to strike directly and/or specialty penetrating munitions)

At this point, probably also a lack of strategic bomber *pilots*, too.",v9uqag
"The Tupolev's 95 need to last till 2040 to be fully paid off, cannot risk them.",v9uqag
"Here is an idea - May be Russians aren‚Äôt those evil monsters people here imagine them to be. 
They use weapons where necessary. 
They didn‚Äôt carpet bomb before the invasion, against all books. When they strike big cities like Kiev or Dnepr or Odessa, they target their strikes, minimising civilian losses. 
Yes, frontline is different. You shoot at them, they shoot at you. But you don‚Äôt shoot they don‚Äôt. Kherson. Berdyansk. Intact, no drama, residents are happy and peaceful. 
So when you say why don‚Äôt they carpet bomb - that‚Äôs why.",v9uqag

"""If"" they win, but assuming they do -

Personally I think it should go back to how it was before 2014, gaining back all of the Donbas and Crimea.

The Lend Lease Act that the U.S. will sign soon will be the end of Ukraine begging. Ukraine will buy now and pay later for anything the U.S. makes except nuclear and chemical weapons. Russia has no chance of winning‚Ä¶.",ueg7xu
If the Russians keep losing people and equipment anything is possible.  I think that Ukraine getting all of its lost territory back is the first thing on the list..  Traversing the Volgograd gap maybe a tall order that they Ukrainians couldn't pull off.  I hope that the Ukrainians kick the Russians out of their country and the Russian chill on the Nukes,ueg7xu
"When they win, part of the settlement should include a full confession the the Russian public.",ueg7xu
no. go play a 4x game.,ueg7xu
Ukraine should be allowed to sell pieces of Russia to whoever wants it so they can rebuild what Russia has destroyed. I'd pay for St. Petersburg. It's nice.,ueg7xu
Ukraine absorbs the former Russia. I real democracy moves forward.,ueg7xu
At least 20 miles wide.,ueg7xu
wouldn't the best idea be to consult kazakhstan and georgia about that first?,ueg7xu
"Russian government will use nukes at any suggestion of losing territory. Highly unlikely Ukraine will regain Donbas or Crimea. Even with western arms, Ukraine is too weak for offensive operations. Most likely scenario is a bloody stalemate lasting years.",ueg7xu
Lol well who knows if any of the land will be usable probably have to evacuate the entire region after all the nuclear bombs start going off ! Who knows if the United States will be hit ! I don‚Äôt support Russia but to topple Russia you are talking nuclear war,ueg7xu
Yea that won‚Äôt cause world war 3,ueg7xu
"I think what happens in Russia really depends on international community appetite. And to be honest, I think that most countries outside Ukraine think:

\- Eastern Ukraine - OK  
\- Crimea - OK  
\- Russian territory - probably not OK

The only caveat I'd put on that is that if it is clear that there are legit independence movements in the west of Russia, then Ukraine might be able to help them. I think that there are people who don't want to be part of Russia in Russia, but I don't think that they are willing to go to war for it. There isn't a clear ideology or social movement to support independent states in Russia and the very brutal fight that would be needed to attain it.",ueg7xu
"They should sit tightly and focusing on rebuilding their country and getting their people back.  The only expanding territory that Ukraine should focus on is Crimea and Donbas. 

Georgia can fight Russia the way Ukraine is doing in the meantime",ueg7xu
"Well, FYI there are more country's inside Russia. Not just Georgia.",ueg7xu
"I would definitely explain if I was Ukraine.

Not only taking back Crimea but also pushing south-east at a minimum from Dolzhans to Samarskoye using the Taganrog Bay and the M-4 interstate as a boarder 

And if possible from Dolzhans to Novocherkassk south to the established river border of Georgia in Sochi.
Cutting off all Black See access.",ueg7xu
This is a dumb question.,ueg7xu
You really should read a couple history books before you embarrass yourself asking such poorly thought out questions,ueg7xu
nope.,ueg7xu
"Understand that a defensive war on your own soil (like Ukraine is fighting now) is much easier to win than an offensive war where you are fighting on unfriendly soil.  
Your supply trucks are open to ambush, the local citizenry when not actively hostile will still pass along information to the other side, and defending troops are more likely to be familiar with minor terrain issues that will help pick the best defensive spots.   
Even recapturing the Donbas and Crimea parts of Ukraine that have been held by Russia for years will be much more complicated than the current battles. As those regions view themselves as far more Russian than the rest of Ukraine, Russia has built up stockpiles of food, equipment and ammunition for years, and the troops stationed there are familiar with the terrain.",ueg7xu
Russia should be turned into Eastern Ukraine,ueg7xu
Yes,ueg7xu

"Similar to the previous video

Ilya is dead. He got sick and died. He got lost in the woods of Ukraine.

The family asked to see the body and he said not much left of him, just his ass and a leg. 

She asked to see the body again. He said our artillery did a good job and the rest of him dogs will take care. They don't have enough time to bury the (Russian) dead, that's how well they are killing them.

She called him an asshole...",toxyju
Taunting the family of a deceased soldier and laughing about their death is not going to help end the war sooner. It's almost certainly going to backfire.,toxyju
This seems unnecessarily cruel as far I‚Äôm concerned. The question is whether this same man would want his fallen comrades to receive such calls from Russians,toxyju
"I don't know about this. Imho even if it's the enemy, their wifes, parents, kids, siblings... They are not responsible for this shit and don't deserve to get the message with laughing.

I'm pro - Ukrainian in this war, but this is shitty.

Show some respect to them, deliver the message without making the family back in Russia hate Ukraine for this war. This here is the wrong way imho.

I didn't understand anything btw, it's just the attitude. If there is a translation that justifies this behavior I would love to see it.",toxyju
"He is also doing his country a disservice, this phone should have been handed over to Ukraine Army Intelligence right away. I hope they track him through this video and punish him. He is giving Ukraine a bad name in the eyes of the World.",toxyju
"I want Ukraine to win, but don‚Äôt dishonor yourselves.",toxyju
"If your going to call at all, then do it solemnly. Tell them to blame those in charge for sending their loved ones to fight in a criminal war against a good and democratic people. Tell them to hold Putin accountable so that other mothers, wives won‚Äôt receive a call like they have.

Laughing or gloating is unacceptable and does nothing but reaffirm the propaganda Putin is spewing and gives him support at home.",toxyju

"This war has more realtime and social network posting than any prior conflict.

The damage to Russia by just letting the families know their son/father/brother is not coming home, will come back to haunt Putin, and help end the regime.",toxyju
Would‚Äôve gained so much respect if he called them and told them with sympathy and honor. He‚Äôs just giving Russians a reason to justify their shitty war,toxyju
Fuck Putin but you are a complete cunt for laughing in her face for the loss of her son. There are so many boy that clearly don‚Äôt want to be there but don‚Äôt have a choice.,toxyju
"This breaks my heart to see.. I am so emotionally invested in this war.. I follow all the footage and stories from many different places as I can.
And this is just so not necessary. I understand the anger, I understand feelings of revenge. But this is just juvenile. This is not something to gloat about. The biggest impact you can make with a phone call like this is to show the family of the deceased soldier humanity. Even if you feel it is not deserved. In my own life I have people I considered friends who I know 100% have wronged me. But if they need help with something, I will still help them.It doesn‚Äôt make me a better person than they are. It‚Äôs because that type of behavior is beneath me. We are all here together on this journey. Extend the olive branch, not a closed fist. Be the change you want to see in the world.It starts with YOU! 
 
Sidenote‚Ä¶. I know It‚Äôs hard to want to show humanity to your enemy when they have invaded your country leveled your cities, murdered unarmed noncombatants and every other disgusting horrible thing they are doing. But it Has to stop somewhere. Slava Ukraini!",toxyju

OK for everybody giving this man shit in the comments just think for a sec would you be nice and respectful if you have had to witness your country being invaded The destruction of a good part of it and your buddies dying right beside you I guarantee if you went through with this man is probably going through you would be the same way you wouldn‚Äôt give one fuck about some dude that interrupted your life let alone his family not trying to justify what he‚Äôs doing but I understand it slava Ukraine üá∫üá¶,toxyju

Russia has treated Ukrainians like second class citizens for the better part of 100 + years. Many are appalled and offended at the behaviour of the Ukraine soldiers in this video. War makes people do regrettable things and this likely one of them. I know if my country was invaded and the invader was flattening my cities‚Ä¶I‚Äôd probably make that call too.,toxyju
This is the second one of these I've seen. It's not a good look for Ukraine.,toxyju
"Dancing on the graves of felled soldiers is an ugly but understandable part of war. The dead soldier, the living one, and the communication with dead‚Äôs kin is nothing new.

Now with mobile tech being ubiquitous and worldwide, witnessing it in near real-time gives it all a new dimension. 

It will be up to world leaders on what their threshold is for witnessing these moments while also continuing to give Ukraine the equipment and resource support that‚Äôs helping them defend themselves against the invaders.

I understand the anger, I‚Äôd probably even make these calls to the families of soldiers I‚Äôve had to kill to defend my home, but I don‚Äôt know that I‚Äôd want the extra guy in there filming me.",toxyju
"This is so f\*cked up. I can't even find the right words. Pure evil sh\*t. More disturbing than a gore video. How can you do this? I don't know anything about this guy, but even in this current circumstances, or even if he lost somebody, you can't do this. This is not a revenge.   
This is beyond dumb and evil. I hope somebody will properly punish him, now, or after the war. I don't know how, tho. But he needs to look into himself, and ask, what your mother would feel in the same situation. :-((",toxyju
War is hell,toxyju
"Yeah, down-voting this. No one deserves that kind of treatment.",toxyju
"War is war and what Russia does is gruesome but that isn't far behind.

Gloating over someone's death is sick you don't know who he was why hw fought and what he knew. You can notify people about someone's death, it is the honorable thing to do, he is not your enemy anymore.",toxyju
Fuck em. That‚Äôs war. Luckey their even notifying them.,toxyju
"I am pro Ukraine, but this is wrong üòë. shame on the soldier.",toxyju
Fuck Russia military and f*** Putin but in no way is this f****** right that man is laughing. It would be one thing if it was not him joking telling her he's in pieces.,toxyju
This makes me sick tbh,toxyju
"I don't agree with this. This isn't behavior that we should show even to our enemy. Regardless of what the soldiers are doing, these are the people who love and cherish them. To mock their death is unspeakable.",toxyju
"What a job, at least the Ukrainians are doing it as the Russians wont let them know for weeks",toxyju
Remember one thing. All is fair in love and war.,toxyju
This is some lame ass shit. These guys are no better then the enemy when they pull these stunts.,toxyju
Wonder how their families will react when it‚Äôs Russians using Ukrainian phones,toxyju
"I'm not a fan of this at all. 

Be better than the enemy.",toxyju
"Damn she crying, dont worry thousands of ukrainians are crying too. N some ukrainian kids are dead.  Guess its okay to show deceased soldiers family no mercy",toxyju
"I'm pro Ukrainian but this is just a shit thing to do, they are just scumbags. There just becoming as bad as the Russians",toxyju
"Doesnt sit well with me this. I understand why they would, but still",toxyju
"War brings the worst out of everyone, what these guys are doing is absolutely disgusting. The Russian guy who died probably had no say in the matter as there are strict conscription laws in Russia and no freedom of speech.",toxyju
This is just cruel and unbecoming of a true warrior.,toxyju
"This brings shame to you and your county soldier. Be the damn example, that is something you would expect from the Chechens etc.,",toxyju

It damages Ukraine‚Äôs position politically and will have a tangible effect on the war effort. Endangering the very survival of Ukraine for a revenge high is‚Ä¶ short sighted.",toxyju
Hopefully this woman is disturbed enough and everyone she tells about this will be outraged enough to help end the Putin regime somehow someway.,toxyju

"This must be russian propaganda designed to turn the west against Ukraine.  Or else, these are some seriously  messed up people.",toxyju
"I‚Äôve been rooting for Ukraine, but that mother lost a son, she will never see him again. And these ‚Äúsoldiers‚Äù taunt her. He was a human too, after his death he should be treated as such. He is no longer an enemy but a dead son.

This will only hurt Ukraine in the end.",toxyju
If the guy had a phone still 9/10 he was very much a solider in support of this war,toxyju
Oh that‚Äôs just cruel and unnecessary. That woman should never have to go through this.,toxyju
Most of the Russians support killing civilians and Russia denies a war is even taking place. Do more of these videos it will force everyday Russians to finally stand up for themselves,toxyju
This is BS.,toxyju

I‚Äôve seen this footage on the Twitter. Lots of ppl say its fake but I‚Äôm not sure. It defo does have some red flags as its uploaded by Russians. The video marking is blurred and apparently UA tank is moving only forward and backwards which is unusual if you have an enemy tank right in-front of you. The only thing I know is that this kind of close range tank battles have almost NEVER occurred and definitely are very rare. Especially in a flat envoirment like Ukraine. Other thing is the UA tank fired first but hit a tree. Poor bastards if this is real.,xrgwl5

"I think using Russian is better, more mature than name calling. I had a recent experience on Reddit where three individuals that disagreed with my opinion resorted to name calling like little teenagers. This bothered me till I figured out how to block them. If everyone uses Russian it will imprint in their minds as a negative person which it should. Using another name will not have the same long term effect. The actions of the Russians should never be forgotten it should remain in our memory for ever.",uhjysd
"I'll let you in on a little secret many people  may not know.  Trolling doesn't refer to a Troll in the Tolkien/fantasy type of way, like Orcs do.  

Back in the days when IRC and other big chat were popular, people would go 'trolling' (fish by trailing a baited line along behind a boat.) They would use something stupid to try and get someone to bite like = ""I played my XBOX360 for about 2 days before it made me want to do a 360 and walk away.""  And people would spout on and on about how you need to do a 180 to walk away from something.  The trolls found this hilarious, and the tradition has continued.  Sorry to go way off topic.

Down with the Orcs!",uhjysd
Mehh. Their just morons or morons with AK's,uhjysd
I think from a Tolkien perspective they're quite appropriately orcs due to their being massive of them and nothing more than destroying.,uhjysd
"Trolls are huge and come in small numbers. Orcs are barbaric, come in hordes, loot, kill everything human and fight each other for loot",uhjysd
Both are dumb,uhjysd
"I don't get the fad with using orcs, but then again I don't get most fads.",uhjysd
"Trolling isnt an art. It's what you do when you aren't articulate enough to have an actual discussion and provide counter points. 

I could troll people all day, no art required, I'd just rather express my opinion in a way that people can come along, read and maybe change their minds.",uhjysd
"Perhaps the designation Trolls is already been used up a bit. 

The shameless narrative they're trying to plug so Putin can Annex Ukraine but now only the east works only well on their own population. 

It's destructive consequences are there but not as destructive as eating it themselves like most of the Russians.",uhjysd
Orcs are a troll specie,uhjysd
"During the Holocaust, Nazis referred to Jews as rats. Hutus involved in the Rwanda genocide called Tutsis cockroaches. And now some will call Russians Orcs.  

This is classic dehumanisation and isn‚Äôt something to encourage or be proud of. 

Humans are dying on both sides of this conflict.",uhjysd
I‚Äôve been reserving Orcs to refer to Russian soldiers specifically.,uhjysd
They resemble orc hoards to be called anything but a orc. There mindless zombies doing putins bidding,uhjysd

He has ruled Russia for 2 decades and his end goal now is clearly trying to bring back the days of the Soviet Union. He's 69 years old and can either end his life bringing Russia back to full strength or be a laughing stock in history, the global superpower that was humiliated by a civilian population. Which way does everyone else see that going? All I see in this picture is a man willing to do anything.. no matter the cost.",t4nq2j
"I think like you said they need to defend right now and I don't know if escalating would help. Putin is crazy and may start dropping serious stuff. In time I'm sure Nato will have to act unless Russia backs off and I don't see them backing off. 

I'm no expert just my opinion",t4nq2j

"I agree with you but i wouldn't be issuing an all or nothing type statement.  I kind of agree withbyou that the only way putin launches nukes is if he were going to do it anyway, but i also think a good poke in the eye and the bear might bite.

I think the US should say: ""If we have credible information that Russia has used chemical weapons, we will give Ukraine the Polish planes.""",taqbrt
It‚Äôs easy for the US to have the balls and threaten Russia directly. But neighboring NATO countries like Poland and others would suffer first in an all out war. The infographics channel on YouTube has a really good video about a possible conflict with NATO and Russia I would suggest watching it to see how quickly things can escalate from bombing Russian forces to complete mutual destruction. Regardless how the Russian army is doing in Ukraine they still have the majority of its forces intact and I think Putin is holding back on his bombings and air raids compared to what he could possibly do to Ukraine.,taqbrt

Also Putin knows if he involves NATO it means the world is not coming to free Ukraine, they are coming for Moscow. 

And it goes against Putin's wet dream of bringing the old Soviet Union to it's great glory again.

"As far as the water/basic necessities thing: my understanding is that when Russia invaded and annexed Crimea in 2014, the Ukranians dammed up a canal which supplied the majority of the freshwater to the peninsula as a way of choking the occupiers out. So, sort of yes to the claim, but not really how they're claiming it. And who in the West DOESN'T have a bit of a Nazi problem these days (speaking from American experience).",t2m624
"Yeah, I remember a friend of mine talking about how they had problems with water supply in Crimea.",t2m624
Ukraine wasn't the greatest of places before the war. They used to have a lot of corruption when it came to officials. Ukraine is also a religious-ish place so in public people frowned upon anyone who was a part of the LGBT community and they would sometimes be attacked. Let's just be honest. Ukraine wasn't the best of places to live but it wasn't the worst. Putin used anything he could find as justification to invade. And will continue to use anything he can as a reason to continue fighting.,t2m624

"A war is still possible between nato.

Russia has demanded they stop supplying ,
Nato warns not to attack supply routes.

How this can escalate in the near future is if Russia attacks the supply line of nato equipment, which is likely since that is a huge issue for them rn",ta949s
"Thanks for sharing. Independently of what anybody things of your opinion, I think it has been respectfully represented and it is a product of thinking.

On my side I agree with you in the big lines. I do believe we do a lot for Ukraine and we are very likely to do more. However, we cannot go too big too quick because that will ensure Putin reacts like the madman he is.

I also do not believe that the only exit is a nuclear war sooner or later. Honestly, we are waiting - please keep on mind that we are not even a month into this war, so more waiting is expected. We are trying to pressure Putin, enough to struggle at home and international but without triggering him. At the same time, we are giving tools for Ukraine to defend their territory so they succeed, but keeping all the above points moving forward. 

The reason for all this waiting is because Putin does not have time. He needs to save face, and he needs to save it fast. Either Putin wins in Ukraine, or he gets a partial win that he can sell as a big win. Putin needs this, because he needs to keep his ‚Äústrong man‚Äù figure. If he does not have it, somebody in Russia can challenge it. The longer he passes without that success, the more danger of somebody challenging it‚Äôs position. The longer Russia is under economic pressure, the more potential challengers appear. The more time passes, the more likely he could fall. 

And this is exactly what NATO wants. Either Putin falls and he is no longer a problem, or he needs to accept a bad deal and attempt to sell it as a victory. In the later case, he is weaker and will have to do a lot to recover his strong man position. He could also lose and decide to go full North Korea. Either way, Ukraine wins or mostly wins.

NATO cannot afford Ukraine to lose, a stronger Putin at the NATO gates is a horrible outcome. Better than a nuclear war, but still very bad. NATO will continue to support Ukraine and raise the pressure little by little, aiming for Putin to end weaker but also actively avoiding triggering a nuclear war or a stronger Putin at the gates of Europe.",ta949s
"I have 2 comments: 1. Didn't Ukraine ask to be in the NATO in 2020 and I thought they even signed some paper that made them a possible member after they went trough changing government, economy, etc.
And 2. Being a refugee is a human right but other than that, the weapons, medication and supplies i think you're right about those",ta949s
">NATO does not owe Ukraine the existence of its 30 nation state member or the lives of all those who live in under its protection.

This is the most important point. On one hand I understand Ukraine and Zelenski's call for direct participation of NATO and EU, his cointry and people are under attack and their freedom is at stake.

On the other hand NATO or EU participation means at best a bloody WW3 and at worst nuclear war.",ta949s
"NATO can choose now to risk nuclear war to save the lives of Ukrainians, or it can choose later to risk nuclear war to save the lives of Estonians or Latvians or Lithuanians. Because Putin won‚Äôt stop here. That is the harsh truth the appeasers refuse to see. 

Either Putin is rational, and will not destroy the world to fight NATO, or he‚Äôs crazy, and the world is doomed anyway. All you are asking for is that NATO lets the Ukrainians be slaughtered before we find out.",ta949s

"Read the room. Bombing maternity hospitals, killing civilians and planting land mines on evac routes are war crimes.",ta949s
"The US and U.K. both have documents and treaties that promise to uphold the sovereignty of Ukraine and it‚Äôs borders. In the 90s this was created for Ukraine to give over their nukes. This was an agreement including Russia and the US, and it meant really nothing in 2014 and nothing now... (who‚Äôs to say NATO is even a treaty that means anything?) 

But back to the question, If Russia succeeds , Russia will be knocking on NATOs door. Russia will reveal that NATO means nothing for Poland , Baltic‚Äôs, it‚Äôs most disposable member if were gonna be real. Because the question will turn into is NATO ready to go to nuclear war over ‚ÄúPoland/Baltic‚Äôs‚Äù ? 

We are pretty sure if it comes down to that we know how NATO would vote...

Then we have a snowball of problems with a Hitler style dictator who gets to bully Europe with its nukes. It kinda reveals NATO is weak if the aggressor has nukes. Ultimately showing NATO as a fake agreement at the end of the day emboldening aggressors. 

It will be a bad situation for NATO and the west which are ultimately synonyms. Don‚Äôt be so silly and naive here. This might just seem like Ukraine‚Äôs war but in reality it is a war for all of Europe and we have to be very strategic how we handle this but the outcome is crucial for NATO.",ta949s
Put a bounty on Putin,ta949s
Thank you perfectly said. Sorry there is zero interest in boots on the ground. Zero interest in a nuclear war could cause the rest of Europe to seize existing. I no longer believe either side this feels so scripted to pull others in. We are paying the price already with these sanctions. Ukraine had a government that from what i understand was over thrown by Ukraine it does appear that those choices are now have some negative consequences. Russians do not care about loss of soldiers historically they never have. Question who‚Äôs ready to go up against an army that at its peak in 1941-42 was missing 20 soldiers for 1 of there German counter part. By the end of war it was still close to 4-3 soldiers per German. Russia will keep throwing man power at this until they get what they want. Fighting this out doesn‚Äôt seem to be something that Ukraine will be able to do much longer. Peace should try to be reached at all cost or risk of loss of life there will be no Ukraine left. Make peace and fight a gurilla war or risk be slaughtered.,ta949s

But if Ukraine falls, russia will do the same exact thing to its other neighbors, trying to recreate the ussr. will the west allow it? I know they aren‚Äôt and shouldn‚Äôt get involved now but if russia is not stopped, they eventually have to. This is the perfect opportunity fot the west to take down a ‚Äúsuperpower‚Äù that has been toying with the safety of the world for way too long. One way or another, they will step in. Might not be tomorrow but they will.",ta949s
"Great points. But there is also the side that says a big war has already started and we need bold, difficult actions now to avoid even more difficult actions later. Putin is a threat to Europe and the world. Never mind that his military sucks in terms of invasions, it is still massive and can level cities. 

There is no going back and treating this as a self contained incident. Over two million people from Ukraine are refugees in adjecent countries. Two million in two weeks. It is absurd to think this is a self contained conflict that does not involve other countries. It absolutely does even without formal declaration of war or support for Ukraine or Russia. 

We need to stop Putin before Ukraine falls and it will fall. The longer it takes, the more body bags will line the streets. The fewer buildings will remain standing. 

So respectfully, this ""let's not provoke Russia"" mentality needs to end. The regime are a terrorist state that has robbed its citizens, pocketed cash and lives on yacths and villas. NATO is a cabable fighting force. They maintain a professional combined arms multi nation military that already has its ears on the ground in Ukraine. The success of Ukrainian combat units is in part to Western intelligence on Russian ground force movements. 

The West thinks a proxy war is the solution. It is not. This will escalate without immediate intervention to stand up to Putin.",ta949s
"Well said, sad but true.",ta949s
"My view in this is. The western powers for years have ‚Äúpoliced‚Äù the world in the name of freedom and democracy, I realise that‚Äôs not entirely true but it‚Äôs the picture that is always painted. 

We are ok ‚Äúprotecting freedom and democracy‚Äù from fighters who have a hugely technological disadvantage against us but now, a country that is stamping on everything we as the west apparently stand for, who has a similar technological advantage as ourselves, we duck and we bow out and we say we support you Ukraine but we are going to support you from over here. 

I don‚Äôt want world war 3, I don‚Äôt want friends and family to die or get hurt but how can we sit here and pretend this doesn‚Äôt involve us. How can we sit here and say not our problem.

What a long post to oppose a point almost no one makes :) Ukraine urges the whole world to stop Russian aggression. Not NATO specifically.,ta949s
"This assumption that nuclear war is the inevitable result of Russia and NATO going to war is, single handedly, the most geopolitically immature and ignorant point of view an educated adult could possibly take. It‚Äôs reveals a child like Hollywood understanding of international relations. People like Vladimir Putin don‚Äôt build massive billion dollar fuck off mansions in southern Russia just so he can then go and end the world. 

I‚Äôm not sure why you‚Äôve taken this tone that makes it sound like you‚Äôve just discovered Art. 5. It‚Äôs a pretty well known feature of the treaty. But you‚Äôve gone about it backwards. NATO is a multilateral organization of many states, each of them sovereign. After 2005, every sovereign state, NATO member or not, has something called R2P (responsibility to protect). It‚Äôs a cornerstone international legal norm. Poland, and try and follow along here please, is a sovereign state that can act independently of NATO on the basis of R2P. If the Russians want to take that as a casus belli and attack a NATO member state, then it would be them who not only started a war in Ukraine but also with NATO. 

Your main argument here seems to be;

‚ÄúBut but but.. standing up against brutal dictatorship is dangerous. They might get angry with us¬°¬°!!‚Äù 

Yours is the only opinion I know of which has the double distinction of being both correct and pathetic. Yes, if you tell Vladimir Putin that he can‚Äôt ethnically cleanse Georgians from Abkhazia, he is going to be annoyed with you. If you tell him that Ukraine is a sovereign state and he can‚Äôt just murder civilians, he won‚Äôt be too happy with that either. Where are your principles? Are you so scarred of the decayed and decrepit Russian army, the same army which is being humiliated and ripped to shreds in Ukraine?",ta949s
Na. Fuck that and your weak ass spine. Fuck Russian and Putin. Only people baiting anyone is Russians.,ta949s
"Do you share that same sentiment about the west‚Äôs intervention in Libya? Serbia? 

I don‚Äôt know what you‚Äôre fretting about, we have directly engaged Russian forces before and it‚Äôs not lead to a major war. They were directly supplying the Taliban in Afghanistan and it didn‚Äôt lead to a major war. No one is using a nuclear weapon, they‚Äôre simply deterrents for another country not to use theirs. 

NATO owes Ukraine. Ukraine was one of the first countries after the Soviet Union fell to come to NATO to join. NATO has been dicking the dog on that for 30 years.",ta949s
"It‚Äôs in NATO‚Äôs best interest that Ukraine stay free. Did the US owe the french their freedom from the Nazi‚Äôs? No, but it was the right thing to do anyways. Just because we don‚Äôt have to doesn‚Äôt mean we shouldn‚Äôt. That‚Äôs a shitty moral outlook.",ta949s
"I've got as far as the first point you make, I'll work my way though I'm sure....

But while they are not part of NATO that's not an excuse to attack them. Who cares if they aren't part of NATO, I don't particularly like my next door neighbour, we certainly are not in the same friendship groups, but I'd most definately help her out of she were getting attacked by them.....

There's no excuse",ta949s
"Could you please stop trying to bait the rest of the world into this war?  Considering that at the moment, Ukrainians are dying to protect NATO countries, absolutely NATO and Europe owes EVERYTHING to Ukraine.  

I think you should read a bit of Kasparov, Shvets, and Kozyrev to paint a more accurate picture of what's at stake here.  Putin's plans didn't stop in Ukraine but Ukraine stopped his plans.  As for ""We don't want to start WWIII"", well, last I checked, almost every country in the world is already in the fight in some way - sanctions, weapons, etc.  WWIII has started, the question is: how will it end? 

Ukraine has already foiled his plans and saved Europe from his terror.   Every EU citizen owes a debt to the Ukrainian people for saving them.  You're welcome. 

Now the west has a calculus to do on how they'll be judged by history.   

Will Europe and the US be remembered as a ""force for Democracy"" that helped Ukraine not only push russian invaders out of their country but helped bring Putin and his ilk down for good?  

Or will Europe and the U.S. bow their heads in shame for being cowards that let thousands, or millions if this ends up going on for years, of innocents, children, little old ladies get slaughtered before they provided the assistance necessary to defeat the russian fascists.

I highly doubt you're this type of person and maybe you haven't thought of it this way but, the message you're sending comes across like someone who would walk by a woman being raped by a gang of thugs and look the other way, keep walking, and think to yourself ""I have no dog in that fight plus, I'm wearing a really nice suite I'd rather not get dirty"", she'll be fine.  I'll donate to an anti-rape cause when I get home.",ta949s

"Dude you're wasting your time trying to have a reasonable opinion here. 

If it isn't pro Ukraine, anti Russian, full military support and victory for the Ukrainians, people aren't gonna have it.

The West doesn't give a shit about Ukraine, they give a shit about losing influence in Europe. They barely said anything about the more than 8 years of war in the Donbas, the ethnic Russians that live there that protested the coup in 2014. 

What Russia is doing is wrong, but to be so one sided and close minded is not the way to come about reasonable solutions.",ta949s

"Well, tough for you, invading a country means millions of refugees, so YOU are affected.

Imagine the effect to your economy with a sizeable refugee population that has to be housed, fed, and supported. YOU ARE DEFINITELY AFFECTED.

"Three issues:

1. I need to understand more about why Ukraine is not a NATO member.

2. This is, most likely, not just a Ukrainian invasion. Of course no one can forecast perfectly but if helping the Ukrainians now stops Putin from encroaching on others that is a win for everybody.

3. Putin has routinely stated that interference by other countries (which seems to now include humanitarian assustance) will cause problems for that country. I think this is just a nice excuse to go to war with many countries. Do you really think if we idly sat by and watched him slaughter Ukrainians and take the country that would be the end? Moldova next. If it is easy he will continue as he is a mad man who seems more unhinged than usual. The world needs to make it hard for him so he doesn't become emboldened.",ta949s

Absolutely! Well said!,ta949s
"I agree with you, but I think you are arguing from a false premise. NATO is not trying to deliver salvation to Ukraine, it is using Ukraine to further NATO's objectives of weakening Russia. The rhetoric from politicians and media won't outright say that because realism doesn't sell so well at home.",ta949s
It's honestly not about NATO anymore.  It's a level of war crimes that hasn't been seen since WWII.  Russia simply needs to be brought to heel.,ta949s

"Nato isn't doing anything. Its constituent states can do whatever they want. 

Freedom loving democratic peoples (e.g. europe and the americas) hate to see another freedom loving democratic country be ruthlessly invaded by a powerful neighbor looking to destroy their country and subjugate their people. 

We already learned the hard way that a expansionist, idealogical aggressor will not stop unless stopped. So we are supporting our neighbours and friends in that process, because we may be next.

Unless you are FOR a powerful neighbour just sending in tanks and murdering whoever they want. Should we do nothing instead?",ta949s

Why do you think NATO continue to support Ukraine when they ‚Äúdon‚Äôt have to‚Äù?

"Some of this information is wrong. Providing weapons and supplies is not considered an act of war and I‚Äôm pretty sure giving intelligence isn‚Äôt an act of war either.

Also just because Ukraine isn‚Äôt in NATO doesn‚Äôt mean countries can‚Äôt have an alliance with a country outside of NATO and provide training, funding, intelligence and refuge to them. See literally every other war for examples. 

I don‚Äôt know what your angle is but this just sounds like fear mongering to me, knowing well enough that both NATO and non-NATO countries are providing assistance for a democracy being overrun by dictatorship. 

Your argument can be summed up as nobody owes anyone anything and sure you can think that way but don‚Äôt forget when the roles are reversed and you need a friend but no one comes to your help.

NATO involvement causing nuclear war isn‚Äôt black or white. MAD assures that.",ta949s

"The war has already begun. No one is baiting anyone. It the decision of which side of history you gonna be in. WWII started this same way, by isolation and appeasement. We should stop Putin now.

Or face WWIII in coming decade if not earlier with much stronger Russia. Do something now, or burn later with the rest of the world.",ta949s
I guess nukes are the only thing stopping nato from intervention.,ta949s
"Agree. I think a majority of people in NATO countries would like to Russia utterly destroyed for what they've done to Ukraine. But that would result in more suffering and death.  If Russia does attack a NATO country Russia will be ended, and hopefully not the rest of the world along with it.",ta949s
Ukrainian is single handed fending off world war 3. Everyone is behind them..,ta949s
"NATO is there to protect its members. Russia expanding to Ukraine, and thus controlling a border with a NATO ally (Poland) is a direct threat to said NATO ally. In addition, Putin will not stop and has stated he is going to rebuild the USSR which would include NATO allies.

In addition, Ukraine would make a strong NATO ally and would be a great asset to reducing Russias reach while also being in a strategic location.

So, I fail to see how stemming Russia now is in the best long term interest of its members.",ta949s
"Morally, the world owes some basic protections from the aggressor. Employing a defensive no-fly zone comes with somes risks, as does supplying lethal weapons to the invaded. Where is the red line drawn? When Putin uses chemical weapons on children? Invades Moldova? Invades Sweden? Or any another non-NATO country?  
With your logic, Russia can invade all non-NATO countries and NATO sits on the sideline. Every action has a risk. No one knows at the moment what's going to set off Putin? Is it a non-fly zone? No one knows. Maybe, maybe not. Sure there's risk of nukes but that risk has been tested as we progress with further help to Ukraine.   
I agree, NATO does not owe Ukraine anything. Morally, NATO/EU owes Ukraine some basic protections to survive a slaughter as the world stalls and watches behind a screen.",ta949s
"With that same arguements we left Syria to Russia. Syria is now a Russian protectorate and Israel effectively has a border with Russia (Bennetts words not mine). That‚Äôs why Israel is reluctant to follow western sanctions. 

I mean you see where this is going right? Putin did not start in Ukraine and he will not stop in Ukraine if we don‚Äôt stop this madman now.",ta949s
I think they do Owe them salvation as NATO is the reason behind this war.. Not exactly the NATO but the people who control NATO.. They persuaded Ukraine to join nato and now the Russia is onto Ukraine because they could have joined NATO.. So war was inevitable for RUSSIA,ta949s

It is our duty to help as best as we can, draw the red line for Putin and NOT let Ukraine fall to the wrong hands.

Putin is a fascist dictator but he is not a madman. He will not use the nukes.",ta949s
"What you say is true. 

But I can't help thinking, based on past behavior that Ukraine is not the last target. 

If we let our friends in Ukraine fall we will have lost some of our best fighters. 

At some point, we will be dragged into this war. 

Question is, do we let Russia pick them off one by one first?

Seriously though, if there's nuclear war we all die. Even if we survived the initial hits, nuclear winter will take out everyone else on the planet...",ta949s
"Russia and NATO are already at war, you just don't know it yet.",ta949s
"If Russia wins, NATO will be fighting for its own defense next. It doesn't owe Ukraine but as a pure practical concern it needs to ensure Russia loses so it doesn't have to fight later. That's pretty obvious.",ta949s
"To say that NATO can‚Äôt now provide real time intel on Russian movements inside Ukraine sounds like something NATO would say just to not aggravate Russia, but there must be people in NATO unofficially officially unofficially giving heads up to Commanders on the ground. 

For the most , little Ukraine has handled the might of Russia well. But Russia could start carpet bombing as they did in Syria (Russia bombed *alot* of Syrian hospitals). No doubt if Russia stepped this war up a notch we‚Äôd probably see the free fall of Ukraine and it‚Äôs government and army. 
We should do all that we can to help.

The massive difference is that Russia is entirely responsible and unilaterally invaded Ukraine‚Ä¶ and has threatened more. This is not a parallel to WWI. The issue then was Germany was given an inordinate amount of blame and made to shoulder the reparations of all of the entente. It‚Äôs really the only shot that we have to end the conflict on completely favorable terms for Ukraine.,tavnke
"The Russian government is a state-within-a-state. It‚Äôs essentially a mafia organisation with a boss. For the past twenty years those people have plundered and robbed Russia, vastly undermining Russia economic growth in a land with unimaginably vast natural resources. They‚Äôve managed to do this through intimidating their own people and murdering journalists, while rigging elections and arresting the entire opposition. 

Want to know how unimaginably huge the corruption is? Take a look at the state of their armed forces. Billions of dollars stolen by contractors from the taxpayer, ensuring that basic weapons and transport maintenance hasn‚Äôt taken place for years. Their own national armed forces stripped of vital services in order to line men‚Äôs pockets! 

The sanctions have now decimated those men‚Äôs bank balances. Their funding lines are cut off. They can‚Äôt even fly out of the country. 

There is one thing mafia captains will get rid of their boss over: lost profit.

That‚Äôs what sanctions are for.",tavnke

Had this conversation with a friend today. I think the pain of the WW1 sanctions were that they were punitive AFTER the war.

Western military companies are creaming it, so their shareholders are going to be very happy bunnies come Q3 and Q4 earnings reports.

"With love from Russia:
1) Sanctions are not the solution. We have China. We have our own resources to stay alive to produce food and so on. Yes, sanctions will push our economy back for about 20 years. And what? We passed through 90s. We can pass it again (not a pleasant thing).
2) All this Russia is evil thing will end immediately if NATO stops pushing towards our borders. We all understand that the end goal is to place a puppet proUSA government in Russia. We really do not want it.
3) Demonizing Russians make our people afraid and hate the west better then any Russian propaganda.
4) I do not care if Ukraine goes to EU and have proUSA puppet government or anything else. Really. But I feel anxious when USA and UK throws tons of weapons to Ukraine (I am talking not about nowadays. It started in 2013?)
I feel very very sad that NATO have chosen Ukraine for its new battlefield. After Iran, Afghanistan, Egypt etc etc

I have 5,6,7 and more to say.
The main idea is‚Ä¶ let us live alone. The Cold War is over. The Soviet Union is dead. There is no communism threat. We‚Äôve been wading through economic obstacles from USA for more than 60 years. We got used to it. No sanctions will affect. Really.

Ah. And we really will never go a hitlers way. We will never try to conquer Europe. We have plenty territory to be taken care of.",tavnke
üíÄ I think the same.,tavnke
"There are plenty reasons they fight the war.

First, the information they receive is different than ours. There are those screenshots of one of them saying they thought they were liberating Ukraine from a Nazi regime. Remember the ""go fuck yourselves"" in Snake Island? The Russian Warship offered the chance for the Ukranians to surrender. It showed soldiers were not bloodthirsty monsters.

By now, probably they're being fed the idea that the ""correct and innocent civilians"" have fled and all that remains are Nazi sympathizers, hence the war crimes.

Notice how the Russian Army also seem to be having logistic troubles? Probably the soldiers are tired, hungry, dirty and being yelled orders. The morale is on the ground. They are not in a place where they can really reflect ""am I the asshole?""

Also, when people start shooting, I imagine you don't really think at all. Adrenaline pumps, all you do is take cover and shoot back. I have never been to a war, so I can't even begin to imagine how fucked up you are at the end of the day.

He has children and grandchildren, maybe he'll give a second thought to them over his pride, but no one knows.

"there was an intercepted Russian phone call where a guy said that 750 of 800 in his unit have died 

so im betting the Russian casualty rate is even bigger than Ukrainians say",uk7vjr
"Neither side is going to publish actual figures at this time, it's always been standard operating procedure for most countries at war not to admit such things during active wartime. All we have is Ukraine's claims of russian casualties, no doubt a bit exaggerated (and their own, no doubt understated), and the best guesses of others such as NATO and the US. But of course only the countries suffering the losses know what those totals really are, at this point. And even that can be sketchy, with lots of MIA's and prisoners they may not be aware of. Don't expect anything close to reliable numbers, until well after hostilities cease.",uk7vjr
And why the fuck would defending side post their losses?,uk7vjr
"The actual death tolls ? You can check what UK or US is claiming about Russians but for Ukraine it's impossible to find because it not only lowers the troops morale but also the public morale. Look at how many videos there are online from Ukraine. It would be disaster if for example they said Ukraine lost at least half the amount that Russians did.

The latest official death toll for UK is 15000 Russians as of 25 April and for US it's 10000 Russians but it's from 30 March.",uk7vjr

Seen plenty of captured Russians wearing color bans but for some weird reason most videos claiming to be captured Ukrainians no markings. Funny how that works..,twg37j
Some nice white sneakers on a couple of those guys.  Wtf,twg37j
"Fake! I see two of them with red arm bands, they're not wearing them, but one has it in a pocket sticking out and another as it in his hand which he switches to the other hand. Also, only two of them have blue arm bands on. If this was real, they'd all have a mixture of yellow and blue arm bands on, since they need to be able to clearly identifiy themselves to each other to avoid friendly fire.  


This is pure russian BS propaganda.",twg37j
Why did the one guy ripe off a red arm band?,twg37j
No patches? No blue or yellow markings on sleeves.  No Ukraine patch on chest? Nobody being tortured or murdered.  This can‚Äôt be real.,twg37j

The only sneakers I‚Äôve seen on troops have been in the Russians. Thieving little pricks.,twg37j
This video could be 5 years old for all anyone knows. The lack of blue or yellow tape is extremely suspect,twg37j
"Mariupol has been expected to fall for 3 days.

There was a group of Ukrainian marines, a group of territorial defense and Azov, all cut off and besieged 35/40 days fighting.

They haven't had an ammo resupply for 35 days, utilities were cutoff so had no easy access to potable water.

They literally held the city and prevented Russia moving resources north and connecting with northern forces for most of the war, because of that they may have eventually lost this battle but their actions may prove decisive in Ukraine winning the war.

The city had the 3 Ukrainian forces cutoff for the most part from each other.

They should be holding their heads high and be commended for how long they held out so bravely.

I just hope Azov in the factory district keeps strong as it's just gotten harder for them. No idea if the territorial defense forces surrendered as well, waiting to find out.

Also as I said in the last thread on this, they surrendered to DPR forces, I like to think that was a last fuck you to deny Russia their victory.

EDIT: THEY HAVE NOT SURRENDERED!

Almost ALL NEW Russian pow videos show them in their under armor (under insulating clothing) or in their natural camo jackets. (Russian wear mostly digital camo while Ukrainians wear either flat/Matt or tiger camouflage. 

If ALL of Russias side was propaganda in this conflict (fake stunted propped videos), even the pow videos. Then so would the civilian deaths. Then I guess you would have to say all the civilians on the streets of bucha, sumy, and Mariupol. Which is obviously not true. You have to take everything and say everything with a grain of salt.

the war rapidly changed from only attacking military installations to attacking cities to affect the civilian populations will to fight.  That is unfortunately where we find ourselves at the present time with Russia bombing/shelling Ukrainian cities killing the civil population,  The ""West"", on the other hand, is trying to affect the Russian civilian population's willingness to fight through sanctions.  NET:  Not saying it will but it could get to the point, assuming Sanctions fail,  that Ukraine starts targeting the infrastructure of Russia as the next step to affect the Russian population's willingness to fight.  I personally don't think it will come to that, rather the horrendous losses in men and material on a daily basis will eventually become apparent to the Russian population and they'll demand the war stops - may take weeks, months, years, but the eventual outcome is certain imo.",t94hus
They're already alienated man. Most Russians support this war or are too afraid to do anything about it. This protests are miniscule to the ones where it affected their cost of living and well being. The only chance is to make them feel it at home.,t94hus
"As the descendant of Cuban exiles, I can attest that the people always pay a price for the reckless actions of their leaders. The people need to decide if that price is worth paying. 

The world has universally rebuked their country for the actions of their leaders. It‚Äôs up to them to decide if a destabilized economy, no opportunities, poverty, and being pariahs to the rest of the world is a sword is worth falling upon for their leaders. They‚Äôve been called to action, what they do now is up to them.

Your leaders. Your country. Your responsibility.",t94hus
"Russian people are riding cars with ""Z"" on it. They support war, they are funding the war, they give birth to meat sent to Ukraine. I'm pretty sure they get what they deserve. If my country bombs my neighbor I won't be running in the street supporting it. Russians think that watching Netflix is more important than lives of Ukrainian peaceful civilians.  I'm not xenophobic or anything, but in case of Russia, maybe we all should be.",t94hus
It encourages revolt and regime change. That‚Äôs the long game. Getting involved militarily would be foolish.,t94hus
The Russian people are at least complicit in this crime. I have no sympathy for them being unable to pay for their lattes so long as they support their soldiers bombing civilians.,t94hus
"Well, maybe they should chose a better leader.  No sympathy here.",t94hus
"This or nukes or do nothing. Or do you have another idea?

My heart breaks for the Russian people and I hope we can come out of this bringing aid to their people with Putin and the establishment gone. A Russian man came into my work for a purchase at Lush (in America) and told me he was trying to spend what he could before his card was cut off. He was deeply ashamed to speak in public because his accent was apparent.. I gifted him a bath bomb to show some love. I hope the world shows their people empathy. This is a devastating time for them. 

Be ready should it be your turn to stand up to your government, no matter the cost. It is all of our civic duty to hold them accountable. Quit the protests in Russia and fight. Or allow the consequences. Is it any worse a situation than what Ukranians now face?",t94hus
This is a great question. And this current situation will probably be the most significant test. It may end up going a long way in determining how sanctions will be viewed and used in the future. But right now I‚Äôm not sure anyone knows which way it will go.,t94hus
Maybe but maybe not. Thanks to the internet many Russians understand why the world is doing sanctions and will blame Putin,t94hus
"It hurts the stability and the capacity to wage war. Hungry people and unpaid police makes for a chaotic mess which is hard to put to work building/repairing/producing. The army is sitting on the shoulders of civilians, and it's really heavy. The goal is to make that base falter and shake. Hopefully it provokes a regime change... but more surely it greatly affects logistics and effectiveness of a military.",t94hus
You immagine how much paying for reparations will allienate Russian people ...,t94hus
That‚Äôs kinda how war works no matter what nation it is. Been like that since war was ever a thing.,t94hus
No more than the 24/7 feed of state fuelled anti Western propaganda on state run media outlets. Al lot less than B52s over Moscow.,t94hus
"It is possible, that Putin will use nuke, then there will be full economic blockade with West. And Russia has plan in the works to cut internet. Possible, that there will be gulag style prison camps. It can go into full shitshow.",t94hus
"Literally the point. Russia isn‚Äôt sanctioned, Putin is. This is an effort to create a demand from the Russian people to remove him and place a democratic leader in his place. Unhappy population means a less powerful leader, and that‚Äôs the idea",t94hus
"Pretty much spot on. Western currency stocks are going high with al these sanctions, so we already know that sanctions arent being imposed just because they feel bad for Ukraine.",t94hus
I am worried that this could clooner back to bite the west in the long run ala the Treaty of Versailles but it's gotta be done.,t94hus

"In 2019 Putin backed Russia out of the 1977 *[Protocol Additional](https://ihl-databases.icrc.org/ihl/INTRO/470)* - which covers a lot of protections for prisoners (articles 40-45).

Nobody is going to feel bad for Russians getting captured and embarrassed a little. Maybe it‚Äôs not right, but literally nobody will get in trouble for it.

Russia is not even participating in the Geneva convention protocol. While that doesn‚Äôt give a participant country to do as they please, it certainly grants them some leeway, assuming they aren‚Äôt committing blatant human rights violations.

Furthermore, the Geneva convention does not explicitly outline punishment for mistreatment of prisoners. Meaning- punishment is at the discretion of the international court.

So, food  luck getting anyone in Ukraine on the hook for a video of crying troops when Russia isn‚Äôt even participating in the Geneva convention, is the invading aggressor actively destroying a sovereign nation, and is killing civilians.

Anyone who thinks any Ukrainian will even have an eye batted in their direction for these videos is delusional.",tf1jve
The Russian Federation‚Äôs unbridled murder of civilians definitively violates the Geneva Conventions. Fixed it for you.,tf1jve
"It isn't a war, remember? If Putin had declared war on Ukraine, this would apply. But this is just a minor special military operation. And so those videos are simply reporting on the conditions of russian soldiers that lost their way while vacationing in a foreign land. Poor fellas.",tf1jve

It's about the lightest warcrime ever commited. If anything, these videos are proof that POWs are alive and being treated humanely. Ukraine gave them food and medical care. Russia gave them expired dogfood and a bullet in the back.",tf1jve

"Then I feel you're not really understanding just how big a red line that is.  Chemical weapons get you hit with cruise missiles, that precedent was set by Syria...

Deliberate release of nuclear material into the atmosphere... or worse a nuclear weapon... Russian forces would be forced out of Ukraine or be rendered all but useless by cruise missile strikes. 

The strikes would be limited to recognised Ukrainian land,  but any Russians would be reduced to light infantry roving bandit groups if any nuclear provocation took place.",ws8co1
Oh. Ok,ws8co1
"An attack on that plant would spill radiation into neighboring countries and would be considered an attack on NATO. So yes, NATO would respond",ws8co1
"You are right, but Russia should not do that in it's own interest. The problem here is proliferation. If a nuclear power attacks a non-nuclear power employing nukes the message is for everyone to get nukes or they might be attacked, which would increase the number of nuclear powers and in consequence the risk of them getting out of control and ultimately Russia being on the receiving end of a nuclear strike.

They will not do that.",ws8co1
"Uhh... follow the materiel and you'll know what's up.

Forces are easy and fast to relocate, materiel goes first as it's far harder to move en masse. There's been a massive shift and repositioning of materiel across the world in preparation of possible contingencies. This boring minutia doesn't make news headlines- you have to pay attention to small details.

For force movement, pay attention to Navy and Air Force assets as they typically move first. Within the past few days, there's been reports of US bomber repositioning on a scale not seen since the US invasion of Iraq.

This NPP funny business is just the kind of thing that escalations are made from. Right now, it's still a stupid brinkmanship game of chicken waiting to see who'll blink. The ruzz would be blind idiots to ignore the implications of any nuclear incident; false flag or not.",ws8co1
"A nuclear plant fallout in ukraine would affect Russia, EU and some parts of the middle east. Global casus belli not only for NATO. A nuke? Nukes are tools used to threat other countries and to avoid invasions. Using them in ukraine doesn't make any sense and it crosses to many red lines. Without nuclear threat Russia has nothing left, no point wasting that card in ukraine.",ws8co1
"I'm not seeing Russia destroying a nuclear power plant or even using nukes in Ukraine. At least not in the way you think they will (eg: destroying the reactor of a power plant or nuking Kyiv).

To believe that they'll do this, you need to believe Putin is crazy... but I don't think he's crazy or dumb. He knows he fucked up, but he can't just retreat. He also knows that NATO is holding a lot back from the Ukrainians. It's not wise or makes any sense to give NATO a good reason (and one that would have public support) to open the flood gates and provide even more advanced weapons, planes, etc, to Ukraine or even help them directly with strikes inside Ukraine.

Just like it happened with Chernobyl early in the war, both sides will use this in the best way for them. And the modern press, powered by clicks, knows that fear sells and they go crazy with it. Do yourself a favour and limit how much news you consume, then think if it makes sense for Y do to X. For the press, WW3 is always around the corner because that brings people to their sites, to their TV channel, etc... and yet here we are.",ws8co1
Kremlin gremlin stop posting üí©,ws8co1
"I don't think either of those are an automatic trigger of article 5 unless they were on NATO countries territory, or radioactive material drifted into a NATO country. Without being attacked it simply isn't NATO's war and by getting involved without article 5, NATO would be an aggressor not a defender. Being an aggressor plays into Russian propaganda and enables them to play the ""Nasty NATO are attacking us!"" card. Ideally we want their people to be as revolted as the rest of us with their own leadership

I don't think any of us want to see Putin get away with it, and it would be terrible for Ukraine of course, but escalating it beyond the current 3 country involvement could rapidly take it much further and NATO heads will be fully aware of that. I'm not talking about some bogeyman WWW3 or MAD scenario, but a multi-year multi-country regional conflict is not an improvement of the situation.

So without article 5, I would still bet on waiting for attrition being the preferred option.",ws8co1

Then I feel it would be time for me to put my affairs in order. I am part of the first generation that has not lived through a world war. I worry where we are heading.",ws8co1
"If US or NATO believed that Ukraine is going to win they would have stationed troops on the ground as soon as the war started. It wouldn‚Äôt be a stretch to say  that intelligence services in west didn‚Äôt see the war coming. They did see it and thats a fact. Of course most of you will say ‚Äúwhat about the foreign aid‚Äù, but most of the aid coming from the west is disguised as aid while in fact being debt. I think its safe to say that if something does happen with the power plant there wont be much consequences for Russians. Germany will remain with their head hidden ,partly because of hopes of striking better deal for gas prices, and partly because of social issues in the country. Same goes with US.",ws8co1

"It wouldn‚Äôt make any sense for Ukraine to have 5 different type of main battle tank, mixing American, German, French and British design. 
It would be a nightmare in term of logistics, training, and spare parts. Same goes with other type of materials.

A much more realistic and rational things to do, would be to focus on one design, that fit best the Ukrainian needs. And have a real coordinated European industrial effort to mass produce it.",wxlilt
This would be a logistical nightmare for the UAF.,wxlilt
Your hot pockets are ready upstairs honey,wxlilt
"Problem with the equipment and vehicles especiwlly is, you need to have crews trained for them. That tank or helicopter isnt exsctly as easy to use, as your average family car.

Even fast training takes months. Proper training for specialised stuff, like a fighter aircraft, takes several years.",wxlilt
"one word: L O G I S T I C S

&#x200B;

you can't just give a dog's breakfast of gear and expect it to be used effectively. they need uniform equipment they can maintain, not hangar and depot queens that can't be serviced or supplied",wxlilt
Ideas like this show how little people know about war. Why don‚Äôt you just flat out say ‚ÄúI want to fuck Ukrainian logistics so deep into the ground that the Russians make Sun Zu look like a fool‚Äù.,wxlilt
"I'm going to say this, as nicely as I can. 

This ignorant belief that it is only Europe's problem, is the reason Ukraine is in this situation. Russia has acted globally for decades. It should be a complete Global rejection of Russia.",wxlilt
Training and repair not to mention fairly safe location to store items and get them to those who need them.,wxlilt
Any army logistician would hang himself if presented with the task of managing this bullshit idea. The West should focus on deliveries of uniform equipment that is either derived from Soviet technology or requires as little new training and supplies as possible. Like the Polish and Czech T-72 deliveries.,wxlilt
It sounds easy except that equipment is in place in case we are drawn into a fight and our forces need replacements. And because Russia is not the only threat out there is why some country's can't send any arms at all.,wxlilt
"No they can't,  it's like vietnam in reverse (hopefully with the same outcome) , imagine russia sending a bunch of troops to Vietnam in 1968 , they knew they couldn't do it, logistical support they did it big time , reading between the lines, I would imagine US logistical support is kicking an absolute asshole right now",wxlilt
"I think what they're doing is right, Countries with equipment already used by Ukraine donating that, and the other Countries replacing them with their existing stock. Its not only a matter of logistics, but also maintenance as well, so many nations using different equipment to maintain and repair their kit would just bog down Ukraine.",wxlilt
It would all have to go through Poland. We are already under huge risk from ruskies. It would also could start WWIII.,wxlilt
Tldr,wxlilt
Fuuuuck someone get this guy a job at the Pentagon asap!,wxlilt
"I appreciate and agree with the sentiment but European nations have their own concerns when it comes to defense. Since the 90s NATO countries have been cutting back on defense spending which has resulted in the situation we are in now. 

During the Cold War West Germany was a powerhouse, now united Germany is delaying shipments until 2023. France, Germany, and the UK (maybe Italy too) will have to lead the way in my opinion. For too long the US has subsidized European security without other nations contributing a fair amount.",wxlilt
My god I would love to see the look on a Ukrainian logistics officers face if he read this,wxlilt
Remember that Ukrainians are used to fight with sowjet/eastern block equipment. A lot of training would be required. The different types of amunition would also be a logistical nightmare for Ukraine.,wxlilt

"Why the Russian military is doing so badly:

1. They greatly underestimated their opponent as did most other countries. Ukraine turned out to be a sleeping dragon. 
2. Putin greatly overestimated his own militaries capabilities. A good portion of the blame for this is on his underlings. It is thought they have been exaggerating everything from military readiness to technological advances. Downside of dicatatorships is your underlings lie to you because they don't want to be disappeared. 
3. Russia used mostly conscripts. Conscript have horrible morale especially in offensive wars.  They are very poorly trained, lack discipline, were told they were fighting Nazis and would be the saviors of the Ukrainian people who would throw them a  parade in Kyiv. This was very different from the reality they faced as soon as they crossed the border. Oh and they weren't told they were going to war until they actually was in Ukraine.
4. Russia lacks Non Commissioned Officers. This is the backbone of a good military. NCOs are the ones who make sure orders are executed, objectives are achieved and their soldiers are taken care of. 
5. Russia uses a dictatorship style command structures which is like swatting at flies with a sledgehammer. High ranking officers are micro managing troops far far far below their pay grade. Putin is, at times making decisions, that would normally be  made by a colonel. His general are making decisions that are normally made by  the lowest ranked officers such as LTs and captains. 
6. Russian government and military is very corrupt. It is estimated that between 30-60% of funds don't make it to their intended budget targets. This has led to a lot of outdated and poorly maintained equipment and very poorly supplied troops. 
7. Russia, like all dictatorships inflates its military numbers. For example, Russia had the largest tank army or so it was thought. In reality, Russia is counting very old tanks( which it now sending to the front) that have been in storage for 40 plus years and are so severely outdated that they are basically iron coffins. It doesn't matter if you have 10k tanks, If a 20mm chain gun with AP rounds or an RPG can pierce it enough to disable it. You also lose your crews like this. Your soldiers can never survive long enough to gain combat experience.
8. Ukraine is being funded and equipped by NATO. NATO military tech is far superior than what Russia is fielding. 
9. Ukraine has been learning Western military command structure for nearly a decade. They have been learning western military tactics as well. Ukraine's military has been trained to be a professional military. 
10. Ukraine is an all volunteer force. People who volunteer for service learn a lot faster, perform a lot better and have much better morale than drafted people. 
11. Ukrainians are defending their home. Their very existence, culture, and the lives of everyone they care about is at stake. 
12. Ukraine focuses on the preservation of life and of equipment. This gives them soldiers with a lot more experience  and higher morale. Russian military considers its soldiers as expendable as its bullets. 
13. Ukraine has near real time access to the best intelligence network on the planet. The intelligence services of multiple NATO countries are providing Ukraine with intelligence. There are multiple AWACS up full time in strategic locations that can give AWACs support over a large portion of Ukraine as well as the Black Sea. 
14. Ukraine has some next level support. They are being supported in every way possible without people fighting Russia for them. Government aid, charities, volunteers, individual people doing everything from fighting for the Ukrainian Army to helping with the flow of goods into Ukraine to giving Ukrainians money directly through social media platforms 
15. Ukrainians know their lands, Russians do not. Knowing the lay of the land and what is where is a huge help. It is a lot different to see it on Google maps and  know what that area is like from personal experience. That gives the Ukrainians a huge  terrain advantage.",v1iak0
"One word: Putin

The 2014 attack on Ukraine cause the Russian economy to tank because of sanction, and combine with the huge amount of [theft/corruption](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i9i47sgi-V4) under his regime, the army was simply not funded and kept declining steadily since 1990 (and before). Command structure likely corrupt, with bribe and promotion of friend over competent people. Military parts getting stolen, fund for new equipment diverted. Just look at the T-14 Armata tank, developped in 2014, yet not even close to being in production. Or the Orlan-10 which cost 100000$ yet can be made from 5000$ parts. Russia army is one of the biggest paper tiger in history (right after USSR/Finland 1939). Also, just maintaining all the military equipment working (nuclear) across all the country cost a lot. And Russia is a former super-power, not even in the top 10 GDP country of the world (behind South Korea and Canada), so there isn't that much money to start with.

Putin is surrounded by yesman and thiefs, because that's what being a dictator do. The attack on Ukraine could only work if could be done in a week or less, like Crimea. For that, Russian invested millions in bribing Ukrainian over 8 years, the only problem was that FSB stole that money. State of the army was greatly over-exaggerated and battle plan was far too optimist, all that to please Putin. Ukraine is huge, and a defender as a 3x to 5x advantage over the attacker, thinking this plan could succeed if Ukraine resisted was dumb (btw, everyone though Ukraine would have fallen).

Putin attack in 2014 was a wakeup call for Ukraine and the world. Since then, Ukrainian army went on massive training from US/UK/Canada/etc developing it's army to Western standard, receiving military equipment, building their own and more importantly, getting experience fighting in the Donbass.

Finally, Putin own view on Ukraine as a ""sub"" country (or subculture) without a real strong & united government and with large part of the population wanting to be part of Russia. He was blind to the actual risks. The West seeing Ukraine still there after a week, decided to invest heavily military, which was another major variable that was not part of Putin plan. At this stage, it's a battle of attrition, and Russia is losing a lot (soldiers&equipment), but Ukraine too (soldiers&civilians&infrastructure). It's now a race to see who will stand last.",v1iak0
Ukraine is being bankrolled by the US and NATO with some of the best equipment and intel possible. Also corruption and poor tactical leadership from the Russians have hindered their capabilities.,v1iak0
Russia doesn‚Äôt have a massive economy. California has 3x Russia‚Äôs GDP,v1iak0
Less than half? It's like barely 20% at the moment.,v1iak0
"Corruption, piggybacking off the reputation of Soviet Union (which was at its peak in 70s before the decline) and just having more nukes than everyone else earned Russia a spot on the ‚Äústrongest army‚Äù list. Their doctrine is simple: throw people at the enemy until enemy runs out of bullets. In order for this tactic to work, pray that you have more people than enemy has bullets. Apart from that, what‚Äôs important is to understand is that eventually corruption ate away the potential. All those ‚Äúmodernizations‚Äù and we‚Äôve yet to see their ‚Äúarmada supertank‚Äù in battlefield (not to mention shit breaks down on fucking parades, you can imagine how badly it‚Äôll perform on the battlefield). Or the UGV (unmanned ground vehicle) they used in Syria once and called it success (Mostly cuz Syrian rebels don‚Äôt have javelins). Failure to establish air superiority AND the important factor of Russia‚Äôs failure: determination of Ukrainian people who don‚Äôt want to give up their freedom and identity under harmful narrative of ‚Äúbrotherly nations‚Äù.",v1iak0
Corruption transformed Russia's army from a bear with teeth to a paper tiger.,v1iak0
"Corruption, arrogance, pride....",v1iak0
"Underestimated the opponent. They thought it was going to be a cakewalk and it wasn't. Also, the state of the Russian military isn't near what it was, and it seems like Ukraine takes better care if their equipment. Also, there are some in Ukraine who are old enough to remember life in the USSR and I'm sure they've told their kids and grandkids that they (the kids) would rather die than live under Russian rule again",v1iak0
"russia entered the war as a house of cards. Even with the little progress ru has made, it is not sustainable. Ukraine will not stop and will not concede. ru has accrued significant losses that cannot be regained in the time needed. They have shown their hand now by trying to contract 50 yr old men to fight and tout nuclear war. This can only come from pure desperation. They are trying to win by brute force with numbers, but the majority are not fit for combat or have low morale. They will collapse, it is inevitable.",v1iak0
"That is the face of dictaorships! The amount of corruption is huge. Because of fundamental fears in the system, one won‚Äôt tell the truth from bottom and upwards. Lies genarate new lies, and when the Story reach the leaders, it‚Äôs baiscally completly different from the origin. Dictsorships are constructed for the leaders and not the suffering people. Putin is the worst dictaor in the world.",v1iak0
https://youtu.be/i9i47sgi-V4 this is a good explanation why the hell happens what happens,v1iak0
"Russian economy is 11th largest economy, below Brazil and just above South-Korea...",v1iak0
"Corruption: Caused soldiers to be poorly equipped and poorly trained.
Vehicles to be poorly maintained. 
Development of new logistical vehicles to be non existent.
Development of new tactics to adjust to modern warfare, non existent. 
Low salaries for mid level command means they have very little leadership on the ground(also why we see so many dead high ranking Russians.. they're forced to go to the front to lead their men).
Then there's the double edged sword of propaganda and misinformation.
Most Russians actually believe their leaders BS. They really believed that they're going to liberate the poor, uneducated, mistreated Ukrainians from 'drug addicted Nazis'. Then when they were faced with reality, they lost all motivation to fight.",v1iak0
"Because they based their initial war plan on faulty intelligence and have since been falling to adapt. Their initial strategy was probably sound if their flawed assumptions were true, but the Ukrainians also get a vote, and you need to adapt when a strategy fails.

I personally was convinced in the beginning of 2022, that they were not going to attack. The Americans discovered their troop concentrations and Biden showed them to the world. Those forces were located on three sides of Ukraine, but were not enough to capture the country.

Turns out, they were trying to repeat their experience from 2014 in Crimea at a larger scale, but failed. Crimea was a very successful operation because there was no functioning army or special services in Ukraine (as much as 25% of officers were Russian assets).

So here are the arguments that this is what happened:

Faulty intelligence:

* Christo Grozev from Bellingcat claims Russia budgeted huge sums of money to bribe various Ukrainians to surrender. Seems like the the money instead was pocketed by Russian intelligence, whose chief is now under arrest.
* They did account for popular resistance, hence the rossgvardia that was deployed to Ukraine, but underestimated the martial spirit and training of the Ukrainian Armed Forces which instead of surrendering fought hard. Instead of managing an occupation they had to fight an entrenched and motivated army
* They thought the West wouldn't respond - just like it didn't do much in 2014. This time around Biden signaled hard for months that he sees what the Russians are doing and he will challenge it and yet Putin proceeded as usual.

Failing to adapt - Strategic:

* Because they didn't expect much initial resistance, they didn't have enough supplies for longer campaigns; the Ukrainian army and partizans targeted fuel and supply convoys successfully.
* The whole Kiev/Sumy theatre was oriented around a strike deep in enemy territory, the forces there were stuck without supplies, ambushed and bombarded by Drones and artillery. They lost the battle in North and retreated in Belarus and Russia; worst kind of adaptation.
* A similar situation played out in the South-West Odesa direction - the Russians were overextended on the major roads and had to pull back.
* While they were successful in the South-East, they couldn't develop that success because their forces were split in other areas. Their adaptation there is shrinking the objectives - from encircling the whole East to the Dnipro, to just the Donbass, to now only the last towns in the Luhansk oblast.

Failing to adapt - Air Power:

* Air and missiles strikes all over the country on the first day failed to destroy enough military objectives (like the Ukrainian Airforce, C&C)
* They switched to essentially terrorising Ukraine into submission. This seems to have been what they have been doing in Syria to all opposing forces, but it takes a lot of time and has failed so far in Ukraine.
* When the bombardment failed to achieve military or political objectives, they didn't stop or change strategies, but started exhausting stocks and switching to even less effective older missiles and bombs.
* Time is running out on the Airforce - if Ukraine gets advanced AA systems the Russian Air Power will be grounded.

Failing to adapt - sufficient troops:

* Ukraine has increased its troops from around 200k to 700k, thanks to General Mobilisation. Which makes further capture of significant ground much harder. In comparison Russia has mobilised only the population of Donbass, which didn't have many men of military age (most left long before the February escalation).
* Out of 900k thousand soldiers Russia has on paper, 500k are various types of ""internal troops"" or gendarmerie; while useful for occupation, they are not ready or suitable to fight regular forces and are needed to keep Russia itself stable. From the remaining 400k, half are in and around Ukraine, the others are in the many fleets (Baltic, Black, Northern, Pacific), maintain the too many nuclear weapons, service the airforce and deployed around the country with the largest territory on earth.
* Russia spent much of the last 20 years destroying its capability of general mobilisation/total war. It was part corruption (sell off the required assets), part modernization (regulars are better), and a huge part politics (its dangerous for the regime). Regardless if it is the right way to go, the state didn't do anything to fix the manpower shortage.

Failing to adapt - weapons:

* Drones like the Bayraktar TB2, integrated with Artillery were hugely proven in conflicts since 2015 - in Lybia, Syria and Azerbaijan. The Russian army countered by putting ""cope cages"" on their tanks.
* Failed to respond to a proliferation of all kinds of antitank weapons; keep losing tanks in large numbers.

Failing to adapt - international relations

* Although much of Europe doesn't care about Ukraine and want business as usual, Russia threatens and insults European countries
* Their only reluctant ally seems to be Belarus; they haven't changed diplomatic course to get new ones.
* The massacres in Bucha and other places put Russia even in worse diplomatic isolation, and has created 0 desire in Ukrainian society and much of the West for a negotiated seasefire, which will be a limited victory for Russia if it happened right now.

Failing to adapt - economics

* The government decided to defend the nominal exchange rate of the rouble over all else. This kept the rate stable, but the currency effectively untradable, trading inflation for shortages of goods.
* Sanctions were ineffective on Russia's exports as oil and gas are still in-demand commodities; however Russia has failed so far to dodge even the small sanctions on imports. After all, ask any economist and they will tell you the whole point of international trade is to get goods from abroad you want; exports are just a means to that end.
* Financial assets - much of what Russia has abroad is frozen or confiscated. Did it use for example crypto or 3rd countries to hide such assets? Nope.
* The import troubles meant that military production has decreased significantly. The USSR dealt with that by having a huge intelligence apparatus to smuggle required goods and technologies. Russia is not as isolated economically yet, but hasn't done anything in that regard.

To me the key question is how Ukraine will adapt - can it learn to take the counter-offensive in a larger-scale and turn the bad Russian performance into a defeat?",v1iak0
Russia has never been a super power. Like ever.,v1iak0
"Russia *was* a super power, 30 years ago. It wasn't anymore 30 years ago because if a hollowed out system, rotting, which probably set in much before 30 years ago.  Then it had a decade or more of utter chaos until Putin whether w elike or hate him, brought some semblance of stability.

Turns out that stability came at the expense of rot eating away everything beneath the surface, the stability was something between reality and a mirage.",v1iak0
"First, I would not say Russia is a ""superpower"" - it is a regional power. Possession of nuclear weapons doesn't necessarily mean a nation is a superpower.

I think it boils down to institutional incompetence in the Russian military that runs back decades, into Soviet times (not much has changed). Russian hubris will be their undoing.

Poor logistics/supply chain management. ""Bullets don't fly without supply"" is a military logistics slogan that apparently is not in use in the Russian military lexicon.

Ukrainians have been spending the last 8 years preparing for war against Russia. They have been rotating combat forces in and out of Donbas since 2014 and have been actively training with NATO forces since. They are also being well supplied and no doubt are receiving plenty of  battlefield and signals intelligence from Western partners. Plus, the Russians have been generally incompetent when it comes to OpSec and a lot of the times Ukrainian units and intelligence services don't really need a ton of support to keep tabs on Russian movements. 

Ukrainians have the home field advantage here, and being the country that is being invaded gives the Ukrainian armed forces a strong sense of purpose and duty, that counts so much for battlefield morale. 

Just my 2¬¢",v1iak0
Putin surrounded himself with corrupt yes men who told him exactly what he wanted to hear,v1iak0
Russia has a military the size of a superpower but the budget of a country like France. On top of this Russian soldiers were sent into battle without a clear reason leading to low morale. I‚Äôm sure corruption also plays a significant role. Ukrainians on the other hand have high morale and I would not be surprised if they can mobilize 1M soldiers by fall. They also seem to have a more western style military structure that allows them flexibility. Western aid has undoubtedly made a difference too,v1iak0
"I'm not going to try to put these in order of importance - I'm going to sort of group related items and do multiple post to keep this from being insanely long.

A - Pre war preparations

1 - Focus

Ukraine) Ukraine's military has trained/equipped/designed almost exclusively to do one single thing - defend against the country against an invasion by Russia. I feel like people skip the importance of this.

Russia) Russia's military has mostly (but not exclusively)  trained/equipped/designed to do one thing - defend Russia from a NATO/US invasion. You see this largely in there failure to emphasize logistics - the Russian army is not supposed to be operating outside Russia in large numbers for extended periods.

2 - Realism

Ukraine) Ukraine's realistic preparations for a protentional invasion by Russia - Ukraine made a realistic review of its forces after it separated from Russia (though not immediately) and modified units that did not meet its needs. The primary example is its conversion of nearly all its airborne assault troops to mechanized infantry. Airborne units (as we see in Russia) are generally the most highly line infantry units but being airborne their equipment decisions included a weight element and it means they are designed to operate without tanks and heavy artillery, even their APCs are designed with less armor. By changing Ukraine changing its airborne units to mechanized infantry it freed them to integrate tanks and heavy artillery directly into the unit. The light infantry forces it kept all exist for a reason (specialized mountain or swamp combat units or TDF militias). This follows to the fact their units are well trained, their equipment is well maintained and they purposed an aggressive program to reduce corruption

Russia) As opposed to Russia which seems to fixate of fancy new weapons but not on critical boring thing like maintenance, anti-corruption, and logistics. In the first days of the war Russia was abandoning their wheeled APCs constantly due to flat tires. The boring stuff wins wars - a mechanized army can't fight without food, fuel, ammo and proper maintenance. Some of Russia's units are well trained, equipped and maintained like their SOF units, airborne and Moscow area parade units - but the whole army needs to operate at this level not just some units.

3 - Other items

Ukraine) Formal command structure in Ukraine Armed Forces for ad-hoc militias (TDF units) , most of the militias have done limited fighting (some exceptions exist - there are a few units that have been fighting in the East for nearly the whole war) - though there are  cases where they critically have plugged gaps when Ukraine had no other units available. Ukraine has very effectively used the units to free better trained and equipped Army units for front line duties. Examples are defending the Ukraine border crossings in areas Russia is unlikely to attack, guard infrastructure (bridges, railway lines, electrical stations, etc) and checkpoint security.

Ukraine) International (Specifically but not exclusively the USA) support. Foreign supplies of modern anti-tank weapons especially.  But also training in the western military style of war - which is to have a core of senior enlisted (NCOs) and junior officers that were trained and empowered to make decisions without always consulting higher command as opposed to the Russia system of top down command where the lower ranks are not empowered or trained to act without direct orders.

Ukraine) Ukraine higher command officers fundamentally understanding both styles of warfare. Ukraine's higher command officers almost all served in a Soviet styled command structure in the Ukraine and their oldest generals served as part of the Soviet army prior to Ukraine separating, You have an general officer staff that has trained for basically a decade in western style tactics but also understands how a Soviet style army (i.e. Russia) thinks and reacts.",v1iak0
2nd biggest country in Europe,v1iak0
"A common problem many authoritarian regimes have is the way the state is run, top down, is reflected in the way the military is run. Those in power do not want to share that power with the lower ranks, fearing that too much initiative will lead to rebellion. In modern warfare initiative from the lower ranks has shown to be the most effective. 

Another common problem for those regimes is wide spread corruption. Those in power care mostly for themselves and their position. They do everything to stay in that position. The state and how it is run is secondary to that. Money meant for the military went to the pockets of those in power.

Russia has created an appearance of a powerful nation, which works as long as you do not have to show that power. But hell, even the USA could not win in Afghanistan and they also failed in Iraq. In modern times occupying a nation that does not want to be occupied is impossible. 

So with an army build on appearance, but in reality really poorly maintained, with a top down structure, fighting against a relatively well equipped and trained nation backed by the deep pockets of other nations.. you are doomed. 

And lastly Putin vastly underestimated how supportive those in Ukraine would be.",v1iak0
"Russia has poor tactics, training, discipline, it just goes on and on. Just one example, by day 5 of the war, the Russia army almost came to a complete stop. The reason was that during times of peace, you store the bulk of your military supply vehicles until you actually need them. Most militaries have manuals that explain that storing fuel and supply trucks outdoors requires to turn all the trucks 180 degrees every few months to start the engines and lubricate the rubber seals so they don't go dry and crack, and to also make sure all the tyre get equal time in the sun as sunlight degrades rubber over time. 

Instead what happened was all the supply vehicles failed within a week and Russia could not supply fuel or food, what did they all have in common? Blown tyres. Did not help that they were also probably Chinese tyres, and God knows what other corners were cut whilst the corrupt generals and command just pocketed the money. 

Ukrainians have been paranoid since 2014 invasion of Crimea, so has most of northern Europe , so the European and americans have been training side by side with the Ukrainians for over 6 years , the Ukrainians training  tactics and organisation is as modern as most global armies. The Russian are forcing minorities to join, there using prisoners, murderers and degenerates,  with reports of mass rapes and mass murders upon unarmed civilians being common place. 

The US military and most others keep their generals behind the front lines, to get a better overall view of battle to better direct the battle. The Russians have their general riding shotgun on the front lines,  he is there to force his soldier to fight, and kill anyone who runs away, there is no discipline or trust. 

Iv also heard former soldiers commenting how Russian air power is under trained and do not work or cover their ground forces, they work independently. Every time you see US vehicles in theatre, they would usually have arial cover. Russians don't do that. 

USA, Europe and much of the world knows, its inevitably, that we too will be at war with Russia, soon.  That is why we're trying so hard to supply Ukraine with as much short range high tech weaponry that requires no training, the more Ukraine destroys now, the less the we will have to destroy later.   Short range is the only way the we can help without seeming like its actually fighting, same with the no training. So Russia cannot legally accuse us of actually fighting side by side with Ukraine. 

Nothing long range has yet been approved, so Russian artillery (Russia's strength) is mostly out of range from Ukrainian weaponry (for now), so they can just sit there and level cities, and could keep that up for years.  Another reason for no long range weapons is that Ukraine would be able to take the fight into Russia territory, which again we would forcibly become involved as invaders, and not just aid and support. 

It is believed Russia has around 5,000 nuclear warheads, and now claims to have hypersonic missles,  the ability to hit any major US city in about half an hour with no possible countermeasures ( yet). That is why no long-range support.  Yet.",v1iak0
">Russia is a world super power with one of the largests economy's and military's in the world with active military help from multiple other groups.

Maybe these assumptions are not really true?",v1iak0
"Russia has a tiny economy - there are a few billionaire oligarchs, but the majority are poor alcoholics. China and India are likely assisting Russia financially.",v1iak0
"See post A for more items. I'm going to sort of group related items and do multiple post to keep this from being insanely long.B - Active war differences1 - TacticsUkraine) Ukraine has repeatedly shown that they will reinforce and dig in on an objective that they understand Russia wants. Make Russia as high a price as possible and then fall back to the next defensible position, destroying bridges, rails and other infrastructure Russia needs as they retreat. They ambush and snipe advancing forces but generally don't attack them in large numbers, unless its critical (like during the battle of Kyiv). As you don't want to fight a bigger enemy like Russia where they are strong. Instead they excel at find Russia's weak spots are attacking there. In the North before Russia withdrew they attacked the rear highways, supply lines and forward operating supply bases. The best way to win a war is not to kill the enemy but to remove their ability and their will to fight - cut-off units from their food for a week and watch the chaos.

Russia) Russia's objectives are largely very obvious and to some extent openly communicated. Their tactics lack proper coordination between branches or even inside units. You see armored units advancing down unsecured roads at the front lines without infantry or air cover. At least Russia seems to be coordinating with their artillery now.

2 - Value of human life

Ukraine) Ukraine has had to make hard choices to sacrifice certain units to save the country as whole, but they are not in large numbers just throwing away their men's lives indifferently, (some of this happens in any large war so I won't say its none)

Russia) Seems wildly indifferent to the casualties their poor tactics are causing and as such aren't learning from mistakes. You see Russia losing hundreds of men in a river crossing and they just try again the next day in a nearby spot like anything is going to change

.3 - Morale

Ukraine) Ukraine's army is volunteer and understands what it is fighting for - its existence not only as a nation but as an identity, You see Russian news hosts saying that once the country is captured they should eliminate the Ukrainian language and its history.

Russia) I think many of the Russia men thought they knew what they were fighting for but the longer they fight, the longer they see with their own eyes the disconnect between what they were told and what they are experiencing. That piled on top of a uncaring military force that's taking heavy causalities is just a drain on morale.

"To start with, the Russian military is crap. Poorly trained, poorly equipped, and the idea they 'modernised' meaningfully was just propaganda. I've still no idea why people believed this propaganda when they resorted to barrel bombs and other war crimes in Syria quite recently. 

On top of that the UK intensified training the Ukrainian armed forces in 2014 after Russia invaded Crimea, and started arming Ukraine with truly modern weaponry and equipment in January, a month before Russia invaded. Our local media almost completely ignored this, being more interested in domestic political tit for tat at the time.

Russia expected to roll in to Ukraine and simply win by default, hardly having to fire a bullet. Imagine their surprise when they didn't just face resistance, but got absolutely decimated by high end weaponry, destroying their armour and preventing them from gaining air superiority.

After they repelled the initial onslaught, the EU and the West finally realised this was serious and started supporting Ukraine as well. They now have essentially unlimited high end Western military equipment, whereas Russia just have numbers and barbarity.",v1iak0
"30 years of corruption. That's why. 

I'm from Russia, if you ask me - we can solve ANY problem with money. The bigger the problem - the more money you'll need. 

In a country where the police is able to make a living only scamming people or stopping cars out of the bushes for a fine (that you can get half off if goes to the policeman) 

In a country where every single budget is being cut among the government and every piece of that chain

You starting having an idea where the military money go? How the equipment is being maintained? How much food people have? I'm not even worried about their nukes to be honest",v1iak0
Because they are arrogant and most of their military does not want to be there. The problem is they seem to have learned from the thrashing they got in the first few months of the war and are now being more careful. They are slowly gaining territory. If the US doesn't start supplying Ukraine with some serious weapons it could go bad. At the moment Russia can sit in their warships in Crimea and fire cruise missiles with no risk to themselves. Ukraine need long range missiles to neutralise this threat but Any country supplying them will be viewed by Russia badly. Ukraine needs a way to take out those warships.,v1iak0

\#2: Russia's army isn't really organised or trained for external offensive operations. It's primarily an internal defence and repression tool. As is evident from their horrible logistics. This means it's extremely centrally led. Junior officers and NCO's at the front have almost no tactical initiative, because the higher-ups are mortified this might lead to too much independent thinking, and this might lead to rebellion.

"1. Very very poor leadership on a tactical and strategic level. They have not applied the lessons learned from previous wars at all. This includes poor communication both in the sense that the leadership has no idea what is going on and in the sense that the Ukrainians and the West tapped into Russian comms with shocking ease. 

2. It was doomed to fail from the very start when they assumed they would not meet resistance and had no planning or preparation for if they did, meaning they have improvised for most of the conflict since the first week. 

3. Laughable logistical problems which has only recently been dealt with, giving the Ukrainians time to mobilise and dig in. 

4. The difference in weapons used. Ukrainian weapons issued by the West are leaps and bounds ahead of what Russia has. 

5. Also the failure to use the ‚Äòcombined arms‚Äô tactic which has existed since WW1, they are trying to use tanks as cavalry.

6. The disregard/ignorance of satellite imagery. The world can see every move the Russians make from above, which is incidentally how the UK and US knew Russia was going to invade as early as (apparently) 2 years in advance.",v1iak0

"Most of those tanks are ""warehoused"" which in reality means older vehicles rusting in open air with none of them ready to deploy without serious, serious effort.

The personnel are concentrated in areas that will not see ground combat and is flush with conscripts. Rosgvardia alone has hundreds of thousands personnel, but is lightly equipped with few vehicles and nothing heavier that BTRs.

According to Wikipedia, the Russian Ground Forces have 280,000 active-duty soldiers. I have seen estimates of active tanks numbering from 2,600 - 2,800.",uoozv4
"russia inflates its numbers quite a bit.  They used to run ""exercises"" where they claimed they had 400,000 personnel involved and 500 planes.  It was like a quarter of those numbers, which is still impressive but not what they claimed.. They also do not have modern equipment to hand out to any additional personnel.  They can claim a million man army but that isn't a professional force, most aren't even contracted, they are yet to even be conscripted.

To mobilize additional BTRs they will need to start a war mobilization to replace what they ahve lost and what they will need to replace along their vast borders.  What you are seeing in ukraine is what they have.",uoozv4

"The 12000 tanks figures doesn‚Äôt reflect reality. 
They have ¬´¬†only¬†¬ª 2000 active tanks and 10 000 in reserves. Meaning those 10 000 tanks have been sitting in a scrapyard for 30+ years, exposed to the elements and looters ( lots of precious metals and optics have gone missing) 

They could probably reactivate a few thousands of those tank, but they would still need some serious maintenance effort. And their combat value would be dubious at best. 
Because, as we have seen so far, tanks designed in the 70¬¥s don‚Äôt fare so good against missile from 2020",uoozv4
"Having 12,000 of something poorly designed, built, maintained and manned does not make you impressive.

It makes you an easy target, if you can get to the frontline at all.",uoozv4
"Total military personel is not telling you how many of those people fight on the front line. 

The total army includes people like maintance, command, logistics. Also Russians didn't throw all of their force into this war because that would leave them open to attack from other countries. They have around 60% of the forces in Ukraine. 

Intel from US says that they have between 169,000 and 190,000 personnel in Ukraine. When you put 25,000 people against those numbers then you can see how much it actually hurts the Russians. 

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Now for the tanks the number of 12,420 includes not ready for battle tanks. From what I read those numbers also include 50 years old tanks. Not really the best tanks for modern combat.

There is no exact number for how many tanks they can deploy but it's probably around 20% of this 12,420. 

Also the problem is not how many tanks can you deploy. The problem is how many tank crews can you deploy. It sounds stupid for some but you can have million tanks but you need the people that know how to use them. That's why NATO can't send their own tanks or fighters to Ukraine.

In NATO countries crew is as important as tank and design represents that.

In Russia crew and tanks doesn't matter and you can see that also. 

Have you ever seen the flying tank turrets ? Yeah there is a dead crew inside.  

What that means for Russia is that with let's say 100 tanks destroyed there is probably 80 tank crews that need to be replaced . That takes a lot of time.",uoozv4
"Russia, like all authoritarian governments embellish a lot. Authoritarian governments like to show off their military tech. They see it as showing adversaries how strong they are and that you should fear them! It is a poor strategy, as other countries  work on how to defeat what you are showing and what you are claiming. Since these governments embellish capabilities of these weapons, the tech that is created to defeat them usually ends up being overkill. 

Russia does create modern tech concepts. But it doesn't matter if you have the tech or not, if you can't produce it in sufficient numbers. You see this with their T-14 tank, Su-57 fighter, and their new hypersonic missile. While these are modern weapons, they are not produced in sufficient quantities to have any impact on any military campaign. 

Russia also doesn't learn lessons from its own military experiences, little lone that of other countries. For example, the newest production tanks the t-90s still suffer from the same problems at the older tanks. They have autoloaders in their turrets and weak armor on the turret top. The US developed the Javelin specifically to take advantage of this design flaw. A javelin hits from the top down  and the penetrator round explodes the Russian ammo in the turret instantly popping the turret off and completely destroying the tank. By contrast, Western tanks have blow out panels for  ammo storage which makes survivability of the crew much more likely. The new Russian  t-14 tanks have an armored crew compartment and  remote controlled turret. However, they still put ammo in the turret. It hasn't been tested yet, but a Javelin is still likely to penetrate a t-14 turret and explode the ammo which will still disable the tank. While the crew might be more likely to survive such an explosion, the tank would still be on fire and thus the crew would be like a lobster in a boiling pot. 

Most of Russia's military equipment is severely out of date. They do not keep military equipment up to date like the West. They just put the older stuff in storage and count it as part of their military. Some of the equipment they are now bringing to the front was produced( not designed) more than 50 years ago with no modernization. 

Russia lacks military commanders at various campaign levels which the news talk about a lot. What is often overlooked is training. Yes they have conscripts that are poorly trained, but because Russia considers soldiers to be as expendable as ammo, soldiers are thrown at the enemy with no concern for the preservation of life.  The result of this is not only poorly trained soldiers but soldiers who never live long enough to gain battle experience. 

In contrast to this the West tries to preserve the life of its soldiers. This focus of preservation of soldiers makes a world of difference in battle. You get higher morale, better training because it is worth investing more in soldiers you are trying to keep alive for as long as possible, and experience. These experienced soldiers can then move of the ranks and become your NCOs which are vital to the effectiveness of a military. 

Back to the actual weapons...

In contrast to Russia's massive paper tiger, Western hardware is superior in pretty much every way. As someone else said, look at what the Ukrainians are doing with our low tech weapons. The West uses precision weapons almost exclusively now. Even our howitzers have precision GPS guided ammo. During the First Gulf War guided munitions accounted for only 9% of weapons fired, but accounted for 75% of all successful hits.  This was Western tech 30 years ago. It has advanced quite a bit since then. .

If NATO was to get involved, they would quickly overpower Russia. The Russian military is no match for NATO. The assault from cruise missiles and F-35s alone would crush their military and that is just two weapon systems. NATO soldiers are not only highly trained by highly trained to fight together despite being from different cultures and countries.  It is a stark contrast from Russia who can't even get cohesion between units in the same branch of service. 

If NATO could take on and defeat Russia, why don't we to prevent the massacre of more innocent Ukrainians? Well we don't for a few reasons:

1. NATO is a **defensive only** alliance, something that the Russian government has a really hard time grasping. If a member attacks Russia in Russian territory or a non NATO country such as Ukraine, then the NATO defense doctrine does not apply. Thus only that county and any volunteer countries would join in. 
2. NATO countries aren't going to let other NATO countries use their soil to attack Russia. It makes them an immediate target. So any country that attacks Russia before it attacks a NATO country will either have to do so from its own territory  or from neutral or ally( in the attack) territory. 
3. The only country that would be confident enough to take Russia on solo is the US. The US has the firepower, and military assets to wage a conventional war solo against Russia. The Pacific and Atlantic oceans make it difficult to attack American infrastructure. However, it would present a logistical headache which will make waging such a ware significantly more costly. Other NATO countries, while being able to toe  to toe with Russia( from what we have seen in Ukraine) are to close to Russia and would see their infrastructure attacked. Even in a conventional war, Russia would still destroy infrastructure and kill a lot of innocents in any European countries that attacked it. As we have seen they don't really concern themselves to much with loss of life on any side. 
4. Aggression by any NATO nation is likely to make Russia feel like its very existence is threatened which is one of the conditions in which Russian Nuclear Doctrine says that nukes can be used. Ukraine is not a threat, from Russian perspective, to Russian territory. Worst case scenario, Ukraine takes back its own territory, but the Kremlin is still confident it can win in Ukraine. It is very unlikely that Ukrainian troops would push into Russian territory even in a worst case scenario( from a Russian perspective). 
5. If Russia manages to land even one nuke in Europe the loss in life would be massive. The Wests put a high value on life especially that of innocent life. 
6. We don't know what China and North Korea is going to do. Both countries have nukes. China is very unlikely to use nukes except as a last resort desperate move. However Kim Jong-un is batshit crazy and is through to have about 20 nuclear warheads. He would be likely to launch against South Korea  or Japan and not the US but even one nuke landing would be devastating. 
7. North Korea might see it as an opportunity to attack South Korea. The US has enough assets to support South Korea in the theater but if things go south it could strain the US ability to add assets to the fight against Russia or the defense of South Korea. 
8. We don't know what China will do. China doesn't have an aggressive warmongering history. They prefer economical dominance and prefer to gain power through influence and economies rather than raw power. However, Russia is...on paper, their strongest ally. So they might come to the defense of Russia. Also they may use the opportunity to engage in taking assets they want in the South China Sea like Taiwan. The US would likely not risk a war with China if they weren't supporting Russia with military. 

Those are a lot of reason why NATO and its members aren't doing more in Ukraine. I probably missed a few.",uoozv4

">12.000 units

Those numbers are outdated. There was an [evaluation](https://www.reddit.com/r/Military/comments/u4q9ie/this_mad_lad_studied_satellite_maps_to_figure_out/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3) done with satellite picture to demonstrate it's half that number of tank that are in storage (6000) and only about half of that (3000) seem to be serviceable. And we are talking +30 years hardware, not the latest & greatest at all.

You need to remember that USSR had a big military budget (it was the cold war), but Russia which inherited big portion of the military hardware does not have such budget (in part because it's smaller country, because Russia is putting money elsewhere, and also because Putin & friend are stealing part of the GDP).  Also, Russia GDP sit between Canada and Australia.

So don't believe those numbers as either accurate or representative of the military power of Russia.

Ukraine said to have 2600 tanks, say 40% functional and not destroyed due to air strikes at beginning of war, 50% destroyed, 520 tanks. Add in 240 from Poland =720, add 100 (out of 233 captured) = 820 tanks in combat.

And why is that? Because of the insane amount of propaganda.,ta3sbx
"According to[the Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2022/03/08/russia-public-opinion-ukraine-invasion/) it is closer to 58%. So yes, still a majority, but by a much smaller margin. You also have to remember that Russia is a state in which you can be arrested for speaking against the government, this accounts for the large number of people on the fence or declined to answer. It may account for a small number of people who would simply say they support the government no matter what.

If you compare these opinion poll to those of Americans during the [invasion of Iraq](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_opinion_in_the_United_States_on_the_invasion_of_Iraq#Invasion_of_Iraq) you see very similar numbers. Many Americans at the time were fed lots of propaganda through mainstream media and felt their government was truly trying to avoid a nuclear disaster. Many protested the war, but many also supported it. Heck, some people still support it to this day. 

It isn‚Äôt that these people are evil villains. Just like any other country they have their biases and their faults. Believing a certain people are evil, whether it is based on: race, religion, ethnicity, citizenship, etc, is a slippery slope. It is one of the first steps in a war, demonize the other side, because it is easier to kill someone who you see as less than human. 

The most we can do is provide other media in an attempt to convince the Russian people that their government is doing something wrong. Hopefully we can do that and convince them to encourage their government to end the war. After the war we focus on punishing those who actually committed these atrocities and trying to rebuild. 

Demonizing the Russian people will not help, if anything it will lead to more suffering. After WWI there were so many sanctions/reparations on the German people, to atone for their sins, that it opened the door for extremism and as a result the Nazi party. I could see the same thing happening if people continue to demonize the Russian people. They are pawns. It doesn‚Äôt mean they can‚Äôt be held responsible for actions they take, but to hold a whole people accountable for the actions of their government is not the right move.",ta3sbx
I think it was a DW interviewer who went looking to interview ethnic russians along the border in estonia.  He found the numbers to be 50/50 with even his guide refusing to take a side.

"Yeah but what story have they been spun about it?  I seriously doubt 71% of Russians support occupying Ukraine to return to the glory of the Soviet empire.

If it is random numbers then it supports this post, the majority were strongly pro-war and pro Putin. If the numbers are targeted at supporters then I guess it means nothing.

I composed my own messages rather than using the templates, I told the truth about the war and they are being misled, I referred to them as 'friend'.

I messaged hundreds of Russians on WhatsApp, I was mostly met with anger towards, and slurs about the West.

You're in your living room watching Russian state TV (as there isn't anything else fun to do in Russia any more). Your telephone rings.

Voice on the phone: This is the state opinion poll. Is this Sergey Petrov?

You: Y-yes.

Here's another poll by Alexey Navalniy, which paints quite a bit different picture of the support of the war. Especially as it is getting more and more obvious that it wasn't a parade march to Kyiv:

"I saw a similar stat(68%) for ""suporting the military operation"", OP bare in mind they are being lied to and most dont understamd the extent of what is going on there.",ta3sbx

On top of Ukraine Neutrality, Putin wants complete disarm of the country (almost no military infrastructures within the borders) and reinstate a new ""legitimate non-neo-nazi-fascist"" government. Which just means pro-russia putin puppets, which the people do not want, and will never accept. Thus, Ukraine would never accept these terms, particularly the last one. They rather die than see a pro-russian leadership again.",t8abli

"On April 16th [Zelensky](https://www.gbnews.uk/news/russian-war-dead-reaches-20000-compared-to-3000-ukrainians-says-zelenskyy/273425) said 2000\~3000 Ukrainian soldiers died , compare to an estimate 20000 Russia soldiers. Wounded are normally about 3 times the of number of dead.

Zelensky obviously picked optimist numbers, but today possibly 5000\~7500 Ukrainian soldiers have died, while a more realistic estimate gives \~25000 dead Russian.  Sadly, as with every war, it's the civilian population that get hit the most (more then 10000 Ukrainian civilians dead)

These opposite numbers can be explained by Ukraine having the defender advantage and training/preparing  8 years for this war,  while Russia army simply being incompetent everywhere (man and hardware). I can think only of the Finland war to see a more incompetent army attacking (which happen to be Russian), and this war will go in history are one of the worst humiliation of a modern army. That's the problem with having a dictator has head of state: you get surrounded by yes man and eventually make very bad decisions.

So let's assume the real number is 20k russians dead. Many of them were killed inside tanks and armoured vehicles, in groups of 3-7. Seems like, and it's a rough guess, the majority of russians died in ambushes, not on ""one on one"" fights. Therefore, my guess is that ""3 to 1"" proportion between attackers and defenders apply, and thus the number of casualties in the UKR army should be around 20k/3 = \~7k.",ujg6kv
"Certainly high. But with defender‚Äôs advantage, the differences in weapons used and superior leadership it is very likely that Russian losses are much higher. 

The important thing isnt the casualties though, its time. Ukraine has all the time in the world to meticulously take back every inch of their country, politics, economy and resources means that time isnt a luxury the Russians have.",ujg6kv
Nice try Ivan,ujg6kv
no one except the ukrainian government knows,ujg6kv
"i would guess half of the russian losses simply because defenders have the advantage and that large parts of the russian forces have been considered combat ineffective and had to pull back.

that said the Ukrainian losses have alot of dead civilians and that would probably make the numbers even,so russia loses soldiers and ukraine loses civilians.",ujg6kv
There are none.,ujg6kv
probably 10 to 20K,ujg6kv
Its likely around the same as the russians/nazis.,ujg6kv
Its important to specify do you mean dead or overall casualties? Because we only have numbers for dead. Generally for every KIA there are 3 wounded but we dont have solid figures for either side,ujg6kv
"There was a quote along the lines of. We are not doing as well as the Finish in WW2 but are very close. We may beat that ration by the time this is over.

I‚Äôm paraphrasing.

The Finish ratio was about 10 to 1.",ujg6kv
Estimates are at 7000 I think,ujg6kv
"So here is the speculation from a YT channel I watch called War in Ukraine, mixed in with my own suspicions.

Basically Ukraine casualty numbers consist of their regular army, not their militia.  So in some towns there has been heavy heavy militia losses that aren't technically 'troop' losses. Basically, a fair way to ballpark it is like this : \[Ukraine troop losses + Ukraine militia losses = Russian troop losses\].  This was speculation from that channel based on reports from other sources and sources on the ground.",ujg6kv

Putin has been cut off from the world. Russia will be a pariah state and will take decades to recover, if they ever will recover.

It is gut wrenching to see the photos coming out from the war, and the sheer evil that is Putin.

The West is doing something about it. It is leveling Russia as we speak. It is economic warfare of which the world has never seen. It can be tempting to want blood, violence, and revenge. But what do you want to see? More violence?

"If we're basing it on personality, Putin is not likely the guy who will push that button. Putin is very calculating, always thinks first before acting, always wanted overwhelming advantage when he wants to go into something, Putin loves his self more than anything in the world, he is vain to the max, look he is still using Botox, doing press conference in CGI with flight attendants to make himself appear macho, he has propaganda about his physical prowess from Judo, swimming to everything under the sun. Look at him now hiding and cowering on his bunker after ordering the atrocities to Ukraine people. That's not the guy who wants to push the button--he wants to live forever more than anything. What Putin does is purely bluffs. He doesn't have the vaunted gigantic Zelensky balls nor the loose screw head of Hitler.

U.S. and allies right now is already pulling an oki doke on his face by providing Lethal arms that already killed hundreds and thousands of his Russian forces in front of him. Just today after he mentioned that banning oil from Russia is equivalent of declaring war to Russia, what did the U.S. just did anyway? Yep, oil embargo. PUtin is a bluffer, he doesn't have it. U.S. and allies are inching closer and closer to finding it out. They know it, they just don't want to move in recklessly.",tae5iz

If Putin puts a foot wrong in Western Europe he is toast.  End of story.

But we're not gonna call his bluff.  He is.  He will blink soon, and regret it.  He's already shown his hand, and it a very weak one at that.  
He is the one bleeding resources, bleeding his economy and coming under pressure from within.  
The west has time on its side.  Ukraine doesnt, but that is unfortunately a very difficult path we have to take right now.  Putin is playing games, and losing so far.  He doesn't stand a good chance of winning.  
Wait and see.",tae5iz
I agree. He can't hold the world hostage anymore.,tae5iz
"I feel you, and thank God I'm not a politician either. And while I realize that WW3 likely equals global nuclear destruction, he's already said that he considers the sanctions an 'act of war', as well as us providing them with armaments an 'act of war' and that essentially any military intervention on our part will be met with nuclear retaliation (even though we've technically done all of that to some extent already). Not saying that he's bluffing or not, just that his recent words and actions haven't been at all rational or even in his best interest. What's he do next if he conquers Ukraine? And what's he do next if he isn't able to? Pack his bags, tell the troops to come home and pretend like this never happened? Continue fighting for another 20 years while the world treats him like a North Korean pariah? What's going through his head when the Pope says, ""Hey Asshole, stop it"" and he then continues on by bombing a maternity ward during a ceasefire? If nothing else and his fucked up convictions are sincere, he's seriously gotta realize that he's only making himself look like a complete monster to the rest of the world.

I've just got this bad feeling that it's only a matter of 'when' not 'if' WW3 happens because of all this (*really* hoping I'm wrong). Will he go a bridge too far and accidentally fuck up (or his half-assed military does), bringing everyone into the fray under Article 5, or is he truly irrational enough to possibly *want* to goad everyone to the point of attacking him? The madman dictator version of suicide by cop. Does he know his time is coming up and is grandiose enough to want to take the whole world with him? And not that I would want the same pain and demise to be inflicted on the Russian populace, but what if we could potentially avoid global destruction by preemptively nuking him first (Kremlin, Moscow, and his Ural Mountain underground city), possibly something he wouldn't be expecting? Every single city in Russia? It's a horrible thought, but it's entirely possible and potentially something that could spare the lives of the remaining 98% of the world's population versus the likely outcome of a global nuclear war.

It's all terrible and hopefully I'm just being incredibly pessimistic by expecting the worst possible outcomes. And in the meantime, we're stuck watching the innocent people of Ukraine getting killed while their country is invaded and destroyed without being able to truly lend a useful hand toward stopping their suffering, all while waiting to find out what a madman plans to do next.

A prudent, careful approach is best. If nukes start flying, that‚Äôs the end of humanity.",tae5iz
"At first I agreed with you, but after thinking about it for a while I've gone back on that decision. It's awful to see what's happening every day, but unless you want to risk seeing that everywhere then it's not worth a ww3 until absolutely necessary. I think putting russia into the same isolated state that north korea is in is a much better move. It's not a solution that is going to end the fighting right now, but neither is sending our own troops. We have to think about how to win this in the end. Weaken the country and allow the civilian population to leave the country or rebel. Time is not a friend of pootin right now I don't think. His resources do not grow each day but the alliances do. There is no good outcome for anyone in this. Now we have to support Ukraine anyway we can and refrain from sending the planet into ww3.",tae5iz

"I personally don't see much of a difference between gifting 30 jets and gifting thousands of anti vehicle missiles such as Javelins, Stingers & NLAWs. Putin is not going to go nuclear and have Russia wiped off the map over 30 jets. With bullies you need to call their bluff sooner rather than later. The longer it goes on, the more emboldened and invested they become. What's more there's definitely vibes about neutral countries being given off. I wouldn't be surprised if he went for Moldova and Finland if he succeeded in Ukraine.

Saying that, I wouldn't go for a no fly zone at the moment as that will result in direct clashes between Russian planes and NATO planes. However, gifting tanks/jets/weapons etc to Ukraine would be a way of pushing back at Putin without going all in.",tae5iz
"> know a lot of people think I'm stupid for posting this, but when you have children of your own and you see children hospitals and maternity hospitals being bombed and these kids being slaughtered, it brings out a rage that sickens me to the core and I just want Putin dead and all the soldiers that have taken innocent lives.

Also we learn more each day this war goes on. This event has never happend and its the firt time our world has to react in such a way. Politics used to be way different before the other wars.

1 mad dictator could cause that. Actually, there is a good chance that person could be Putin. What hitler has done when he lost? Suicide.

What do you expect from Putin? If you trigger him enough and make him lose, he might consider suicide. Not with a pistol though, with a nuclear war. That is a planet-earth-over serious threat.

It‚Äôs all a bluff he is just doing this to weaken the us an make us look like fools. Honestly what‚Äôs the difference between weapons bullets an planes. Secondly he knows he launches a nuke it‚Äôs game over. I also given the state of thier army an air force I highly doubt even half of his nukes are even operational. Third fuck Putin .  Fourth the reason why he keeps saying stuff like this is he knows his military is absolutely no match right now for us he is just trying to buy time. Until China invades Taiwan. Also a policy of appeasement never works it‚Äôs just going to eventually end with us in another world war.

"The Maternity hospital bombing clip is probably partially staged.
Look closely and you will notice a lot of details which doesnt make sense at all.

The building is damaged, no question about it but...


First: the guy is filming noise from bombing from afar behind big residental building - how can you know when bombing is coming? 
Then some glass flies from above but all windows on the residental building windows are untouched.
Car alarm sounds are probably added.

Second:
 When camera approaches ""hospital"" u will notice that it is a U shaped building complex. First two buildings are longitudal connected by a land bridge and third is not.
It is located around big apartment buildings.
I googled Mariupol hospital and went thru all of them. 
No hospital looks like that. Try googling Mariupol hospital or maternity hospital
Also - street view doesn't work.

Third: it is snowing. All car wrecks are not smoldering beside one which is burning on the front and back. There are zero fires around.Zero. 

Fourth : no ash or debris flying. When a bomb hits ( and especially this building where the facade is made of stone wool) ash,paper, fibers fly around in the air for quite some time. Here everything looks cool

Fifth : people coming out of building. 
It is really strange that people are coming out only out of single doors in the middle of courtyard whereass the building complex is quite huge. There would be people coming out from all sides. And they re coming rather calm

I believe nato and the us baited Russia into this war and Ukraine is being used as a pawn sadly. Nato said more than once they wanted Ukraine to join and teased him into this. And now that he‚Äôs in they won‚Äôt do anything except send weapons. Now he‚Äôs in a war expending troops and resources.

First few might be to take out a couple of military targets, you know, drop it on a naval fleet take out a Aircraft carrier and a few other targets....US responds doing the same but this time hitting a major Russian base....Russia things fuck it, launches a ICBM to wards a military base on the American mainland and before you know it we have over 10,000 of the most devastating weapons made by man in the skies one hitting every major population centre.

"Time for a bit of reality guys.  NATO is NOT ( now get it in your head) NOT going to participate in this war except for providing materiel support.

Yes, the deaths of billions of people is worse than the deaths of thousands.  Sad truth but fact.

The west is providing the support it can.

Pray for a small group of brave Russians close to the dictator who do something about this.",t7iyk0
Global thermonuclear war would be sad,t7iyk0
"The worldwide support is the reason 60,000 people are in or on their way to fight for ukraines freedom. If nobody was talking about it, nobody would care.",t7iyk0
NATO has done everything short of get involved in the conflict itself.,t7iyk0
NATO has nothing to do with individual cities,t7iyk0
"What's sad is your misguided meme that's not accurate. You know nothing, Jon Snow.",t7iyk0
"Each of our countries are showing solidarity, support at every level & by sending so much stuff to help the best way we can without triggering a nuclear war...

Weapons, humanitarian aids, taking the refugees, sanctions, intelligence information, donations, foreign legion, digital disruption, etc.

Except sanctioning more oligarchs, seizing assets, pressuring foreign corporations to leave the Russian market & continuing what we're doing, we can't do much more *(And we're working hard on that)*... And considering how much the current sanctions are already hitting hard the Russian economy, they won't hold very long, as they are aware the longer they keep biting the worse the sanctions will get.

However, the requests of Nato intervention or closing the sky are as unrealistic as Putin asking Ukraine to not join the alliance, it's impossible with the nuclear threat...

The good news is, the fresh leaked document says that by June Russia's economy will be completely fucked if the situation stays as is it today, so they'll have to withdraw very soon to avoid the total collapse. It's unconfirmed, but very plausible, so stay strong Ukrainians we'll continue to support you to the end üíôüíõ",t7iyk0
"Well, we used to laugh at these.

But see how quickly Germany changed their policy once they saw the massive support for Ukraine among their people.",t7iyk0
It's either that or quite possibly face an extinction level.,t7iyk0
"Dude calm the fuck down. We are waiting for the UA to weaken the RU sufficiently so that we (NATO) can create our own false flag and roll up what‚Äôs left of the RU without sustaining significant casualties. 

Remember. Nobody does war like us",t7iyk0
Dude stop whining you can't expect the united states to help everyone out in every war,t7iyk0
You forgot the clappings,t7iyk0
"Again same topic. 
NATO does all it can since a long time. Two weeks before it even started, they delivered massive amounts of stuff(no need to say details).
They are actually doing all they can and if someone is creating picture like this he's either Russian dog or a fucking hipocrite sitting home with laptop and looking for fame, oh-look how awesome i am. 
The fact is you are fucking pathetic.",t7iyk0
"But what do u want? a war between NATO and Russia would be much worse‚Ä¶and since that psychopath of a putin already put his nukes on standby you never know what a full scale world war will cause‚Ä¶we can‚Äôt simply put boots on Ukrainian soil without creating way more death and destruction‚Ä¶thus we can only help by supplying, economy destroying sanctions and boosting morale.",t7iyk0
"Yeah, no. This is ignorant and does not help the narrative. FFS, havent people learned about the power of disinformation? You want NATO to enter the war? Fine, WW3 is what you get. Don't want WW3? Shut the fuck up. NATO has trained and supplied the Ukr forces for 8 years, with training, gear, weapons ans intelligence and they continue to do so. You're either ignorant as fuck or a russian troll.
Fuck off.",t7iyk0
They are still getting more help than Palestinians or Middle East ever got.,t7iyk0
"Ukraine is not a NATO member, therefore they won‚Äôt get involved and risk a nuclear war. However if Russia attacks a member y‚Äôall can expect a full WW3 nuclear warfare and Russia reduced to ashes.",t7iyk0
"Yes it sure is,  every plane in the world was grounded when 2 American buildings were hit by planes now this country is being turned to dust but sorry we can't stop air traffic over you're country.... hypocritical JMO.",t7iyk0

"""The enemy? His sense of duty was no less than yours, I deem.""

Actually, i would bet the average russian soldier in Ukraine feels very little in the way of a sense of duty right now, other than towards basic survival of himself and hopefully his comrades. Not if all the stories of desertions, abandoning and running away from their positions, mass resignations, ready surrenders and overall lack of morale in their ranks are even half true.

"Send in your best reinforcements in after you send in your conscripts to die? Doesn't make a bit of damn sense plus you will get slowed down trying to get through all of the old burnt out tanks and trucks littering the highway.

I actually pray that you are right, that they send in their best shit last. That would mean if you stop the second wave let's call them their ""good stuff"". That would mean the whole Russian army would be defeated if they are stopped.

It would take years for Russia to rebuild, and I bet most of the western allies would still refuse to do business.

Which means I'll probably start buying Rubles to wipe my ass with for the next decade. Because It will be cheaper than toilet paper. Lol

Eat a dick Putin.",ta6zfv
"Well let me tell you this, you dont usually do this as a convoy such like this would be easily mowed down by air force. Or flanking counter attacks. Also think about this, the war costs Putin about $20bln everyday. With all those sanctions in place, he'd want to end this rather quickly. And yet we see the opposite. 

Furthermore how is Russias newer equipment supposed to get there when the whole thing is stalled? Its the stupidiest thing one can do. Even more so considering, that in worst case you couldn't simple turn around if you had to.",ta6zfv
"This insane theory comes up time and time again on here. My thoughts? Do a quick search.

In short, you don't send thousands of your soldiers to their deaths and lose hundreds of pieces of expensive equipment as part of a ""plan"". You don't send in a bunch of fake vehicles and use the manpower and fuel to get them somewhere for no good reason.",ta6zfv
"I think it's worth keeping in mind that large military operations, even successful ones, are shockingly complicated affairs.  Even successful operations, like D-day, could have ended very differently if only a few variables changed.   It's also worth pointing out that Russian military doctrine is primarily defensive in nature, units are expected to fight in close proximity to the vast Russian rail system.  This is why the logistical arm of the Russian military is much smaller than their Western counterparts.  I seriously doubt the convoy is a planned part of this operation.  I suspect it is instead a symptom of optimistic planning and Murphy's law.",ta6zfv
"So the invasion was supposed to begin in Jan 2022 when the ground was still frozen.  Because it was delayed first until early Feb than late Feb after the Olympics, the ground is no longer frozen hard.  This is/was important because heavy things like tanks don‚Äôt do well in soft wet soil (mud).  Because of this the Russian invasion can‚Äôt maneuver and must use the roads. Having to use the roads is not good for an invading army and greatly favors the defenders. Additionally, as what‚Äôs been mentioned many times before. Russia (Putin) didn‚Äôt think the Ukrainians would fight and it would be a quick war.",ta6zfv

"The misinformation of this conflict is unreal. For example, you can look at the casualty figures. 

Russia says it has lost ~500 soldiers, Ukraine says it has killed more than 12,000. The US estimes russian losses at 2000-4000.

Ukraine says it has lost 110 soldiers, Russia says it has killed 2,870. The US estimates losses at ~1,500. 

As an American, I'm going to believe the figures that we are estimating. Because according to Ukraine, each of their fighters must be some kind of super elite terminators, which is great for propaganda, but I can't believe it.",ta6zfv
"Here are some thoughts from Russia:
1) We see old tanks and APCs. We do know we have newer ones and a lot! Why don‚Äôt we use them? Just to throw all the shit to the battle and have a space for renewal orders (military industry will make money). The fact that our army uses old biplanes like AN-2 modified to fly without a pilot to reveal AA positions proofs the ‚Äúthrow all the shit‚Äù statement.
2) We‚Äôve seen great improvements in Russian army for the last 10 years. New weapons not only in media, but also in the army. A lot of military exercises. Well trained soldiers and officers. But there is an opinion, that our generals are still old morons like in 2008.

3) I and my friends do not support the war itself. But if our country started it why don‚Äôt we finish those tiny Ukrainian troops in a week? We have a fucking huge modern army with a lot of supplies at warehouses. Why does it take so long? That‚Äôs very confusing.",ta6zfv
I apologize for some typos should have proof read before smashing post button,ta6zfv
I fear that he‚Äôll flatten a city or two (Kharkiv for eg) with air strikes & arty then say to Kyiv that the same will happen to them if no surrender. Those troops are to impose power on the ground after surrender. Fuck Putin.,ta6zfv
"I think what's happening is a break down in communication between the ground and what arrives to Putin. Putin employs yes men who carry his will, and they will probably say yes, when the logical answer is no.

Is our infantry force up to scratch? **Yes, Mr Putin.**

Can we invade without resistance? **Yes, Mr Putin.**

Can we manipulate our people for long enough to get this done without backlash? **Yes, Mr Putin.**

Can Lukashenko be trusted? **Yes, Mr Putin.**

Can we take Kyiv in two days? **Yes, Mr Putin.**

Can we do it with a fraction of our force? **Yes, Mr Putin.**

Will we we be able to install a puppet government? **Yes, Mr Putin.**

Can we do it with conscripts to save money? **Yes, Mr Putin. We can even take residents from the Luhansk and Donbass regions.**

Will we be able to complete this before the end of winter when the world needs our exports a whole lot less? **Yes, Mr Putin.**

Bare in mind, part of Putin's ploy was to take Ukraine and the world by surprise. To do this, he kept his own forces in the dark about this mission. The whole world knew what he was planning. Intelligence and satellite imagery was easy to come by outside of Russia, where media is so controlled. The result of that is that his own forces were so in the dark, they were sent into a hostile area often unaware that they would be met with force. It's comparable to the cake walk. There was so much emphasis on being covert, that he managed to sabotage his own invasion. 

Is the stalled convoy part of the plan? In Ukraine's mud season on devastated roads where the front of the convoy is routinely being destroyed or abandoned, and only a fraction are tracked vehicles, they are in trouble. There are munitions trucks, supply trucks, troop trucks that are getting stranded in mud that even the tanks are struggling with.",ta6zfv
"The Russians are deploying a zap Brannigan level strategy. Throw waves and waves of men at them. If the war continues a month, 3 months, 6 months without international intervention Ukraine will fall due to their own supply/numbers. 

So either someone kills Putin soon or WWIII, is my theory.",ta6zfv
[deleted],ta6zfv
"What I have a hard time believing is Ukraine's reports of russian KIA or captured. I hope the numbers actually are what they are claiming, but I honestly feel like what they report is more for propaganda purposes so they can get inside the heads of the russian conscripts. Trust me, I have never wanted to be proven wrong more than this, and when I said I believe this is the precursor to the 3rd world war, because I personally don't believe putang is going to stop with Ukraine, and once his troops set foot inside one of those bordering NATO allies, we are all in it whether we want to be or not.",ta6zfv
i think the convoy is stalling purposefully to allow the eastern flank to catch up.,ta6zfv
"The west will say oh they are so stupid they ran out of gas, they can‚Äôt even make it to kiev 

I believe it‚Äôs more like they are resupplying the convoy for a major offensive against Kiev. It would be epic to see Kiev hold, but I doubt they can.",ta6zfv
"The fact that Russia sought paratroopers from Belarus tells me they don‚Äôt have the resources to execute this war like they thought. Further, two weeks in and they haven‚Äôt secured a single major city and still don‚Äôt have air superiority tells me that they‚Äôre getting bogged down. Russia still has Ukraine in terms of numbers, but they don‚Äôt seem to be deploying it sensibly, which doesn‚Äôt make me think any superior troops they‚Äôre holding on to in reserve will do much better.",ta6zfv
"Honestly the convoy in itself is a logistics problem. Its a two lane road, and trucks are parked on it chaotically. Your trucks furthest up need the most gas, how do you send it past all the trucks behind blocking the road. You can't go off road because of mud or terrain only maybe in limited areas.",ta6zfv
"Could it also be that Putin is actually using these first soldiers as a means for false hope for Ukrainians? Boosting their morale, making them feel unstoppable, making them overconfident, and then sending in the real shit he has knowing that he has given Ukraine a false sense of pride and plans to completely change tactics and surprise Ukraine with the actual tech and forces they have?

Or perhaps he did think that a small fraction of his power would win, and greatly underestimated Ukraine. Thus his frustration. Maybe he misunderstood the minds of the NATO countries leaders. Maybe he realizes his propaganda didn‚Äôt lead to as much international persuasion as he thought. He may very well be stuck in the Soviet era mentally. 

Now I‚Äôm stuck between wondering if he knows exactly what he‚Äôs doing or if he is greatly miscalculating things.",ta6zfv

"Putler first threatens with nukes if Nato interfears.

Now he challenges the West or Nato to fight it out on the battlefield.

He behaves like a narcissistic extorting crime boss.

The advantage he has is that he doesn't care how many Russians he lies to, grinds to nothingness in Ukraine and manipulates into war to divert from his corrupt and totalitarian system.",vuhuo6
Stopped reading after your first paragraph...without going nuclear there is no way orcia could meassure up against Nato.,vuhuo6
I cannot understand beyond domestic propaganda any notion of Russia taking on Nato. It's a complete nonsense given what we have seen in Ukraine. If this conscript laden army was to meet a professional Nato army in the field with air support they would be massacred. There was no military loss in Iraq or Afghanistan.  There is a huge difference in winning a battle vs occupying a country as Russia will find out if it extends beyond pro Russian areas of Ukraine. There was a failure of strategy for the peace - something that would be secondary in any war against Russia where ir would all be about smashing Russian military power.,vuhuo6
"I don't want to sound like the boasting American, but you've really got a skewed view of NATO. 

The US originally approved $400M in aid and was still arguing about what that could include. The US spends $800 BILLION, each and every year on it's military. We have the largest 4 airforces in the world. China is 5th. And we have planes we don't sell even to our allies. Ukraine has never touched a NATO plane.  Even now, what we're sending is the leftovers from the drawdown in Afghanistan, the things that were meant to go there. We certainly didn't train them on our equipment. Russia is so outclassed, we are literally joking about nukes, cuz we know we'd obliterate them before they could try. There is no fighting against our military in a total war situation. 

Everyone gets confused, because we ""lost"" in Afghanistan and Vietnam. We did not militarily. We failed to rebuild their nations or occupy them, and the military was limited by their ROE. Total War will be something else entirely. No limits. It terrifies me and I'm American. 

Add in our allies in NATO, who do have the same training and much of their own MIC, and they could take Russia without US. 

Putin's only option is to contain this war to Ukraine. Trigger NATO and it's over. Period.",vuhuo6
"The smoke and mirrors army has proven to the world that it is 3rd rate in equipment, training, and operational capabilities.  Even if Russia wanted a fight I can honestly state that upon its  performance the CSTO members would be very reluctant to engaging in any conflict.  Russia was a slow starter  and it was ok up the 1940s but in these days you don't have that luxury.  Russia with 1/4 of its  army in the scrap yard. And half its tank core as well wouldn't get past the Baltic states.",vuhuo6
"Ruzzia doesn't seem to have the manpower to take over Ukraine, how the f are they going to confront NATO and take over central Asia? This is a fantasy scenario.",vuhuo6
"The one thing that the war in Ukraine has taught western analysts is that Russian military capabilities have been over estimated for years (ex. they can‚Äôt do combined arms worth a shit). Keeping that in mind, if Russian and NATO forces clashed on the battlefield, they (Russians) would be obliterated in a matter of hours.",vuhuo6
"Except as a philosophical discussion, any speculation on any current 'russian strategy' is now moot.

The russian nation, and it's people, are going to be suffering the full negative after effects of putin's arrogance for generations.

They are fast rendering themselves incapable of militarily influencing events outside their own borders, for an indefinite period of time.

As has already been eloquently stated elsewhere, 'the russian bear has rotten teeth'.",vuhuo6
If NATO wanted to act like Ruzzia they could simply tell the Russian people that they have a week to evacuate their homes and then completely level the place. We can just burn through the rest of our garbage stockpile and make Ruzzia no longer exist. And I‚Äôm not even talking about nuclear capabilities.,vuhuo6
ruzzia has no strategy.,vuhuo6
"I think China should annex as much of Russia and/or ""USSR"" as it can right now. 

Russia couldn't wipe broad swaths of its own ass right now.",vuhuo6
well dude. Central Asia isn't too keen on it and nato didn't need to drive the Russians out there. That's what the Kazakh Uzbeks and Caucasians do themselves. You are still my friend in Soviet times. I mean if the russians want an afganist 10 times bigger please,vuhuo6
Russia is done. Plain and simple. I think Kazakhstan breaking away is the start of a massive shift.,vuhuo6
"Any ru strategy has proven itself half baked √§, irrational, unachievable, and therefore irrelevant",vuhuo6
"Putler Isn't stupid enough to go all out against NATO, partly because he has a whole shitload of people pissed off at him from disenfranchised Afghans, Syrians, and every other minority that has been ground under the ruZZia-NaZi of Zoviet Heel over the years.  These people would be willing to take up arms in a heartbeat to give a licking to the oppreZZerZ who did them dirty years ago, Hell, you might even find some Czarist White Russians willing to go home to fight. Add to that the Estonians, Latvians, Lithuanians, Hungarians, Romanians, Poles, Georgians, Belarusians, Czechs, Slovaks, and all the others that have recently freed themselves from the Zoviet lash, and you have a mighty force standing against Little Putler. As for his statements about Alaska and the northern islands of Japan, SETO is another can of whoop-ass that he may not want to open for similar reasons.",vuhuo6

"I respect and admire these ladies for their convictions and passion but I have truly never understood the baring your tits thing as a power move. No offense, but as a heterosexual male, I can tell you with 100% assuredness that even if what these women were protesting was the most offensive thing in the world to me, I would still be thinking 'o man this is awesome, boobs.' I don't know if they don't understand that they are actually giving men something they really want. Do they think that it is somehow a turn off or a power move or something? Because in the end I think they end up just being sexualized and viewed as a pair of tits. The message gets lost and its turned into something very trite: 'boobies'. There is even that famous photo of female protestors with their tits out, vehemently opposing Putin, he sees them and what is his reaction? A big fucking smile, because he is getting to see a bunch of younger women's tits. They think they are punishing him but in reality they just made his fucking day. I don't get it.",tjtxvy

"In the end. You are talking about the neighbourhood bully who has raped, looted, pillaged and mass-destroyed civilian infrastructure to intimidate. If you are dumb enough to give in to threats the problem will not go away, but get worse. 

NATO's boss also clearly stated that the consequences of not defending are worse than the possible consequences of defending. 

Get Russia out, seize back some of the resources and become a wealthy, thriving state. That will be a credible answer.

Nah. He won't plan any time soon to use nukes. He would then lose a lot more popularity at home. Gotta remember he's an evil piece of shit and self preservation is huge to a personality like his. He nukes anything he's put a nuke target on himself. No way China would back him at all then either. Use of nukes is next level shit and he won't be planning on pressing that button. Not saying he never would but it would have to be something big that does it.,xthck0
"This argument falls flat because Putin risks everything by launching nukes, he goes from just losing Ukraine to losing Russia by doing it as nukes wouldn't just effect Ukraine but Europe itself and so NATO would probably step in....

In summary: right now, Russia has totally lost face (to themselves - this isn‚Äôt about what the rest of the world thinks) and they can‚Äôt stop or withdraw because they have been defeated by ‚Äúmere‚Äù Ukraine. 

They need to provoke attack from a more ‚Äúworthy‚Äù opponent (eg the US) in order to counter this. Then at least their defeat is ‚Äúworthy‚Äù and saves face. It may be that going nuclear is the only way.

The fact that within Ukraine, they‚Äôre preparing for nuclear attack, is enough to worry me to be honest. They know the enemy.",xthck0

"This is utter crap. The EU and UN has spent BILLIONS building Palestine‚Äôs entire civil structure- hospitals, schools, aid agencies. 

Hundreds of human rights charities exist in the west supporting the Palestinian and Syrian people, yet you draw your conclusions from a bunch of ignorant morons on twitter. The boycott of Israel by the west is gigantic and has involved trade unions and millions upon millions of people. 

Why the hell isn‚Äôt **The Arab League** doing anything at all for Palestine? Huh? Last time they did anything even remotely serious was back in the 1970s Arab Oil Embargo. Most Arab countries **won‚Äôt even allow Palestinian refugees into their country**. During the Syrian Civil War Saudi Arabia refused to take **any** Syrian refugees at all. 

Where did they all try to go? TO THE WEST. 

THOUSANDS of western volunteers have fought with the Kurds in Syria and Iraq. 

As for Africa, I‚Äôm utterly sick of being blamed for the past 60+ years of rampant African corruption by African dictators who‚Äôve plundered their own people, starved their populations, and invaded their neighbours in order to enrich themselves and their families. How many more decades does it take before these countries start accepting responsibility for their own brutality?

Of course the Ukraine War is more important- we stand on the edge of a **nuclear holocaust**. 

Delete this rubbish and stop repeating Russian propaganda.",t70zm1
"As I just heard journalist Fareed Zakaria say, this war IS more important than the other wars because Russia has more nuclear weapons than any country in the world, including America, and there is nothing to stop Putin from invading other former Soviet nations that are now free, or Poland, or any other European nation, which of course will inevitably involve the US. Total acquisition of multiple nations was never a concern with other countries waging war because they did not have the ability and weapons to do it.",t70zm1
"Its a combination of things, in random order:

* Its 2022, people are more aware and informed than ever so more people care. This is very much a propagandawar on boths sides.

* Its in europe, war in europe is a very delicate topic. Europe has all the reasons to care more about this war than a war further away.

* It a full out war between two developed armies, of which one has nukes. Of course the potential targets of those nukes care.

As a westerner, its kind of annoying that people blame the west to care more. I think the direct region should care more than the other side of the world. Why should the west care more about wars in other regions than those regions itself? 

You compare potential ww3 with a regional small conflict. The situations are not the same, not even close.",t70zm1

"Its just like in anything today where you cannot have a decent discussion on any subject. Here, we have seen the Russians as ten times worse than ISIS in areas under their control. Who are not abiding by international law in their execution of war yet they kept screaming they are trying to denazify Ukraine.... it more like Russia is now mostly like Germany under Hitler.",xglbm0
"If NATO frontline MBT‚Äôs are out (for reasons that may or may not be valid) then maybe modern tanks could be sourced from a non-NATO country like South Korea ? Poland is buying a lot of their K2 tanks and Turkey is making them under licence so they are NATO compatible w.r.t. armament and by all accounts, the K2 is a very advanced and lethal tank. Nothing like a real-world test to see how good something is and I think the K2 would chew the T-72/80/90‚Äôs up and spit them out.",xglbm0
Believe me ... nobody else ... except Germany .... give a shit. These arguments a pathetic in times of war.,xglbm0
"Plenty of M60A3's and Leopard 1's running around multiple nations.  The 105mm cannons on them will still make short work of all but the absolute latest units if given the right AP ammo... so if they're so scared of presenting Leo 2's and Abrams etc, give them the tech that is also cold war that was designed to counter these cold war vehicles.",xglbm0
"Russia is doing its best to fill in for west with its tanks . 

A few hundred more and Ukraine will be in good shape .
And they are free !",xglbm0
"Who gives a shit what Russians think. They started this latest escalation of what had been an 8-year-old war. People of the West are just plain sick of living with Russian aggression. This war is the definitive ""Bridge Too Far"" moment for most people. No reason to hide it, send the equipment needed to toss these interlopers back to their primitive land and save lives of innocent victims.",xglbm0
And German made PZH 2000 from the Netherlands and Germany are no Problem at all?,xglbm0
"I dont believe your assessment is correct, I believe that is part of the problem but not the whole problem... The biggest issue with Ukraine and modern westen tanks and IFV's is that Ukraine has be using Soviet gear and tactics and its what they are best trained on and bringing in an Abrams will need to train whole new crews and mechanics just to work on the new tanks and they would need their parts and special mechanics near them at all times and cant be simply repaired by mechanics that specialise in Soviet stuff. The Spanish wanted to send some Leopard 2 MBTs but a Ukrainian commander rejected them because its not worth sending just a handful of tanks, they would need whole tank divisions to make them worthwhile and that would be the same with most modern IFV's, it's too costly and would take a lot of time retraining troops to work and maintain these vehicles. If it was all an issue with NATO imagery then why send all these armoured vehicles and anti-tank weapons? Gear that they are sending by bulk since the war began and Russia pushes the narritive you talk about but it doesn't change much.  


The stuff NATO is sending is all easy to learn stuff, easy to maintain and the NATO countries can easily spare but when it comes to tanks and IFV's, Ukraine needs Soviet gear and thats what its been asking for except with the Marder IFV's because Germany has a mass stockpile of them and parts and they are fairly older tech so easier to maintain and its perfect for what Ukraine needs but Germany doesn't want to push too much for fears of Russia crippling their economy with shutting off the gas.",xglbm0
"The US doesn‚Äôt really telegraph what they‚Äôre doing. I expect that we‚Äôve been training Ukrainian troops with our weapons, possibly even fighter aircraft. We‚Äôll have to see what happens once Lend-Lease finally begins. I have doubts we‚Äôd be delivering weapons they haven‚Äôt been trained to use. Would be pretty sweet to see how US fighter/bomber/stealth aircraft would fair against Orcish troops/air defenses. The M1 Abrams is a bit of a different story. It‚Äôs a massive tank, much bigger than Soviet MBTs.",xglbm0
Russia is sending and leaving plenty of tanks,xglbm0
"It doesn‚Äôt matter, we are at war with Russia, whether we like it or not. We just let Ukraine do the fighting with some of our equipment. And they‚Äôre doing a great job!",xglbm0
I just want to see how my army‚Äôs MBT compares to the Russian one‚Äôs. COME ON SEND EM!,xglbm0
Time for countries to grow a set of balls and just get this done.,xglbm0
I‚Äôm not sure how any of this is new info. I‚Äôm fairly sure Government officials have said this bluntly from the start.,xglbm0
"Hear me out on this. If you attack Europe, Europe will respond.",xglbm0
"did we not learn about invading russia in winter? Dont get me wrong, im all about fucking them but take it easy my dudes",xglbm0
Russia has already brainwashed its populace into believing it's fighting NATO. So not giving tanks to Ukraine to avoid something that's already happened is stupid.,xglbm0
Also the infrastructure of Ukraine can‚Äôt handle the weight of most western MBTs . Mostly bridges and for Abrams there is the supply and servicing the gas turbine that is made to be pulled out completely for service unlike T series.,xglbm0
"There are reports of conversations overhead in Macrons office worrying about who will replace Putin being worse. Therefore not wanting Ukraine to win too hard being a reason for holding back on heavy weapons. I think the hope was that sanctions would do the job.
Initially they didn't know if Ukraine would just fold like in the Crimean invasion. US got burned in Kabul with all that lost investment and equipment.
The supply issue is more leveled at Germany as really only Germany and the US have stocks in storage that could be sent.  Leopards as the most successful modern export tank. While the US just has shit loads of everything and deserts to store them in. 
There are also concerns about things like strength of bridges. NATO tanks being a good bit bigger than soviet ones.",xglbm0
"Who the fuck would let a Russian narrative dictate their behavior?  Also for psyops within Russia, I'm pretty sure 99% of reality is an attack vector at this point since the fact weaving by Russian propaganda has integrated so little truth against so many interests that everyone can take one look at the basket and realize they're getting screwed for the sake of holding a lie together.",xglbm0

What is your source regarding Russian control?,u729qq
"Verified aftermath footage?
Reportedly under Russian control?",u729qq
"Here's the problem with the title - there are (at least) TWO major steel plants in Mariupol.  
1 - Illich Steel Works who's name in Ukrainian literally is ""Mariupol Metallurgical Plant named after Illich"" which was just captured by Russian forces. The Ukraine Marines here fought their way out to Azovstal iron and steel works to join the defenders already there. (Though some were cut off and surrendered)  
2-  The Azovstal iron and steel works which in Ukrainian literally means ""Metallurgical Combine Azovstal"" which is where a lot of the fighting in Mariupol is happening now and would under no definition be described as under Russian control.  
So using only part of the literally translated name in the title causes confusion. But (I can't prove it) the pictures definently could be from the Illich Steel Works in Mariupol.",u729qq
The Humvees are Ukrainian. A lot of hummers were given by the USA to Ukraine prior to the war when America was moving forward with the divesting program. Also from what I know the Azovs (along with other Ukrainian units) use those platforms.,u729qq

Put the pipe down.,t8asba
"NATO is a defensive alliance, to ""invade"" a country goes against it's very nature. A common misconception pushed by the Kremlin is that NATO is a military force with assault capabilities.",t8asba
"I had an insane idea last night about having poland defect from Nato, and having Poland going in with of course some other ""defectors"" to bomb convoys and air assets

This is an insanse idea, but hell least im thinking here.",t8asba

So I am not sure but I think he won't be able to nuke anyone. Based on the equipment I have seen I am not sure the missiles were upkept. You can't just buy it and leave it for 20 years.,t81blq
"That‚Äôs what I was thinking too‚Ä¶ oh Russia won‚Äôt invade‚Ä¶ Putins scare tactics. Boy, was I wrong.

Russia won‚Äôt nuke?  I hope to God you‚Äôre right.",t81blq
"You heard it here first folks, Putin won‚Äôt nuke. From the same people that brought you ‚ÄúPutin won‚Äôt invade Ukraine‚Äù",t81blq
"I think the worry is that Putin has left himself nowhere to go. As the war drags on and Russia faces more losses, as sanctions bite hard, he is vulnerable at home. On the world stage he has made himself a pariah. In Europe, he must grind on in Ukraine and win or a defeat would see him likely deposed and Russia humiliated. If that happens, he could well face a war crimes trial. He has become more erratic and gone full Kim Jong Un in quite a short time, perhaps as the pressure mounts. If he miscalculates and Nato gets involved, assuming it commits properly, he knows that defeat is inevitable. The only insurance policy he has left are his nukes.",t81blq
"Only if you believe putin loves anyone or anything but himself. If he's gone mad, he won't care because he won't be around to worry about the consequences.

Let's hope he's not in that mindset.",t81blq
"There's a difference between tactical and strategical nukes. If NATO enters Ukraine in force, who says he wouldn't use the tactical ones?",t81blq
Have you enlisted yet?,t81blq
I don't think it would be the end of the world but I do think there would be a limited exchange.,t81blq
The wager for your bet is the human species.,t81blq
I think his big thing was saying he would nuke should NATO allow Ukraine to join them and therefore would get the full backing and protections of the articles of NATO. But I could very well be wrong just what I remember watching him say,t81blq
"I absolutely believe he‚Äôs crazy, stubborn and proud enough to try and use nuclear weapons rather than face an embarrassing climb down but people are forgetting that it requires more than one person to launch a nuke and should therefore consider, are the people around him really prepared to participate in a nuclear Armageddon? At a basic level, if they love their country/families/selves enough, they surely would put a stop to the madness at the point of launch? All these calculations are being made by people who are on a lot more money than me, thankfully. üò¨",t81blq
"We all know he is smart enough, what we dont know is if he is sane enough...",t81blq
"Its a very unlikely scenario I agree, but Putin putting his nuclear facilities on ""high alert "" is nothing to ignore. If there was even a 1% chance that he uses his nuclear weapons,  its enough to pause for concern. If you care about ukraine,  you wouldn't take this threat lightly. But I can see how comfortable one can feel being across an ocean. The instigation by Nato is what lead to this, and ukranians are paying for it. Dont make matters worse for them by saying Putin is bluffing.

Another thing to note about Russia's cruise missle detection system. It's not as good as the US's. The US can tell if any country in the world fires a nuclear missle ,but russia does not have this global situational awareness. They dont have as much time to react and could do something drastic if they feel a missle is headed towards them.  This is the reason why a US scheduled testing of a cruise missle was postponed due to the war. We did not want Russia to think this test was the real deal. And that was a smart decision.",t81blq
Noone is nuking because there are MULTIPLE levels of people between Putin and the actual guys who turn the key and push the button. Any one or many of those people will refuse the order because they know what it means.,t81blq
Yeah Putin won‚Äôt invade Ukraine either,t81blq

"Honestly, I find this report to be bullshit. I support Ukraine, obviously, but I try like hell to be objective. Long story short, I see little upside from Ukraine pulling this action. I just don't.

And given the fact that the New York Times DEFINITELY isn't what it used to be, I'll remain skeptical for now.",xwk0jm
Why would Ukraine do it? She was a non-entity as is her father. Despite what western media reports state he appeals to the fringe of Russian politics only and even Putin considers him mental. So killing either of them would be a pointless risk and an escalation for very little practical return.,xwk0jm

"as a Ukrainian, many people here did not even know this old man exists before the assassination. When this happened first thing I thought - it was Putin's attempt to make russians angry. And Im sure we have more important targets",xwk0jm
"The New York Times has a grand history of being Pro-russian. A russian partisan group already took responsibility for ""neutralising"" the rat.
Walter Duranty was a Times journalist in the 30's who helped push Stalin's propaganda while millions of Ukrainians were tortured, murdered or starved to death. Google ""Holodomor"".",xwk0jm
"Let‚Äôs assume Ukraine was behind it. That means UA had operatives and network to carry out assassinations of Russian citizens (propagandists, collaborators, etc) without much interference from FSB.

"In defence of the NYT, they simply stated that the US intelligence community believes that the Ukrainian Govt authorized the attack. 

The NYT has a long history of having great sources within US intelligence. 

To be honest, it's pretty great that Ukraine has the capacity to strike backat Ruzzia in so many ways. Multidimensional warfare is complicated the they are up to it. Striking at the Ruzzian political class is just another feather in their cap. 

Slava Ukraini!

Edit: spelling",xwk0jm
"Anyone who supports a genocidal maniac deserves whatever they get. From my understanding she wasn't much better than her father. The US is only publicly condemning it because there might be evidence tying it to Ukraine. They have to publicly scold Ukraine so as to not look like they condone it to keep Russia from throwing a tantrum. In reality, we (the US) do the same shit.",xwk0jm

Didn't the old man encourage genocide against Ukraine? 
Obviously they got the wrong person, but the old man will pay for the rest of his life.
Slava Ukraini",xwk0jm

Russians can kill tens of thousands of Ukrainians, torture hundreds of others, destroy a trillion dollar's worth of homes, schools, businesses and infrastructure and that is less of an issue than offing one stupid mouthy bitch?

NY Times is only a shitty propaganda rag anyway no self respecting person gives a shit about such rags or the opinions of the propagandists who work there. If Ukraine did pull this off Kudos to them and they should finish the job and get the oul fella.,xwk0jm

Russia only holds mock elections. It's a dictatorship under the guise of a democracy. He wouldn't even have enough support in a fair election to secure his parties candidacy. Something like 20% -25% of Russians support him and they are mostly older( 50+) Russians in rural areas.,v7podf

"The creative ideas to resolve this conflict have to match the insanity level of Moscow. One needs to bribe his military, free washing machines and dishwashers for the Lootenants and turret tossing champions. We would also raise the price of Gucci bags by 300% to make the Russian ladies happier. A Russian media professional needs to convince Putin that it would be great PR to ride on a big white Lion. Afterwards, Gerard Depardieu would run for office and negotiate a peace deal with Macron.",v7podf

"Maybe, unless bad vodka or low window in basement.",v7podf
"If the  news about is Illness are true, then no. He will get replaced by a successor either appointed by him or by the Shiloviki ( the FSB/ex KGB guys that are running the show). Sadly i think that both a Coup or an insurrection are an impossibility, Russia will probably become a bigger and norther DPRK.",v7podf

A bit more complicated than that,tm0y3i
[deleted],tm0y3i
"Um no, the us sent Ukraine around 13 billion dollars of aid. 

https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2022/03/18/upshot/ukraine-aid-details.html",tm0y3i
"This is dumb as fuck and does nothing but support the Russian side.

We've seen unprecedented cooperation between EU and Nato countries since the cold war. Us northern countries have stopped our neutrality to send arms for the first time since the winter war. My country and Finland are seriously risking our safety to support Ukraine as much as possible without sending troops. Hell yesterday my government issued 5000 more rockets and other supplies to Ukraine. While also actively taking in refugees and immediately getting these children in schools.

The US sent billions worth of material including food. The EU is seeing populist trying to get ground cause of our severing with Russian gas. We are more united than ever and those javelins, those supplies are what is winning this war for Ukraine. Nobody wants nuclear powers at war, especially not Ukraine.

These are just the things we know of. Pentagon is not transparent at all so military advisors amongst other things are essentially a guarantee we will get confirmation on after the war.

So stop with these unfunny and downright factually incorrect memes. They are supporting the Russian media and war effort that Ukraine is isolated which could not be farther from the truth.",tm0y3i
"The people who agree with this meme would jump into a fist fight to help their friend when he was already winning.  We cannot just jump into a fight that isn‚Äôt ours without some sort of provocation from the belligerent. And as an American taxpayer I feel we are providing the weapons needed along with many other taxpayers in many other nations to defend a nation that is not our own, and not only am I ok with that I‚Äôm intelligent enough to know if there was any area that Russia didn‚Äôt embezzle funds from it would be a practical amount of nukes. This is being handled at a correct pace in the correct manner. Russia has lost the info war completely, and they are going to lose from attrition. Im tired of seeing Ukrainians murdered and I‚Äôm just enraged as every one else but what good does it do is if we ramp it up by attacking Russia then Putin says ok I‚Äôll raise the stakes and drops a nuke on some city in Eastern Europe. People much smarter than anyone on this website are working around the clock on strategy and logistics.",tm0y3i
"So the massive aid all the Western countries are giving to Ukraine despite there being no obligation or any contracts to do so doesn't count for shit? No offence but when you start crying about the help you're getting, people generally don't take ingratitude kindly and will start losing their interest in helping you.

And I know someone's going to say ""Well at least force the no-fly zone!"". In case someone doesn't realize how that is enforced, it is by SHOOTING DOWN ALL aircraft in the area and obstructing taking into the air from at least 200km from the actual no-fly zone. That would mean NATO would have to bomb Russian airbases deep inside Russia. That would be WW3 for all of us.",tm0y3i
We've got a World War 3 enjoyer over here huh,tm0y3i
"Nice meme, unrealistic. Not even a single Russian city was hit with a missile.

Could be true in the future, but not real in the current events I am seeing.",tm0y3i
"With the amount of funding that gets embezzled by Russian government officials and contractors though, evident from the fact billions of dollars worth of bribes weren't paid, billions of dollars worth of funds for military equipment and upkeep being embezzled away. Hell, even what ever people in charge of keeping the Russian army rations up to date and edible clearly embezzled their cut. Leading to the russian shit show on display today.

At what point does Putin maybe start to wonder if that ""high spec, 10 billion dollar reinforced nuclear bunker"" he was promised to get, is really just a 10 thousand dollar hole in the ground lined with dry wall and held together by sticky tape... It's not like the contractors who where in charge of building would care if it wasn't by the time Putin would find out, Putin would be dead and the contractors will be on their yachts.",tm0y3i
"I've read some interesting things from a few military analysts this week that said NATO getting directly involved would actually be great for Putin. He could show his version of this to the Russian people and lie, ""Look! NATO is against us."" I'm not sure how accurate that is, but something to think about.",tm0y3i
No it's not. Drama queen.,tm0y3i
"If the others do more than they are, putin nukes things. Quite possibly leading to an extinction event.",tm0y3i
Let's just ignore all the fucking aide being sent coming in at fucking billions. Wtf are you even talking about?,tm0y3i
Yea but you realise that if World leaders jump in a way more destructive and deadly war will occur? especially since putin knows he can‚Äôt win a war against NATO wich means he‚Äôs very likely to use nuclear force,tm0y3i
"When this is over Metallica should perform Sad But True in russia again.

Not to mention, each name in the top half of this image has done more to help Ukraine than you ever have or will, OP.",tm0y3i

"Turkey has been the strategic lynchpin of NATO since the 1950s, they're not going to be thrown out.",up19ad
"Turkey is an incredibly important ally. They have the largest military in Europe after Russia, control of Bosphorus, have absorbed the vast majority of Syrian refugees and overall play a huge role in moderating western interests in the Middle East. 

Turkey was already punished for buying S-400‚Äôs (maybe the West should start making good short range air defense and Turkey wouldn‚Äôt have to look towards Russia).They were kicked out of the F-35 program that they helped fund for years. 

Turkey is not an ally to Russia and they are constantly competing against eachother geopolitically and in proxy wars. This narrative that Turkey is friendly with Russia is not based in reality. 

Erdogan is threatening to block Finland and Sweden to gain back some of the foreign policy losses over the last few years. They will be promised something like re-entering the F35 program or other policies on the refugee crisis and will eventually vote in favor. Turkey is in an excellent negotiating position at the moment and will also be able to punish/weaken Russia.

I understand your frustration but I feel like it will be worked out (hopefully).",up19ad
This is absolutely about turkey being in position to leverage nato. It‚Äôs just smart politics from their position. I mean politics is just as much about public opinion as it is about actual policy. Turkey is defacto required to negotiate in public.,up19ad
"Just no. You don't build an alliance by threatening expulsion each time you disagree on something. Alliances are always very political, and Turkey is simply playing its cards well by asking for something in exchange of accepting Finland/Sweden (in this case PKK and Kurdistan related) at the right moment. It will be up to diplomats to figure out a solution, but in the end Turkey benefit from being part of NATO, and a bigger NATO is better for them.

Also, do you think expelling Turkey will be a good thing for NATO? Outside NATO, Turkey will seek new partners, and soon you could see Russian/China Navy or Army base appearing in Turkey. Turkey has a key position between Europe/Asia/Africa, you want them to be in your team, even if the current leadership is not ideal.

PS: You should like at Hungary for a country to pressure out of NATO. They have so ""close"" tie with Russia, that most NATO [secrets](https://www.politico.eu/article/moscow-spooks-return-to-hungary-raising-nato-hackles/) planning is in the hand of Russia.

Even the Swedes and Finns don‚Äôt seem too worried about it at this point.

Turkey is a valuable contributor to the alliance, even if they have their own interests that are unique and at times rub the West the wrong way. They are in NATO to stay, in their current president will not be there forever, either.",up19ad

"Well, there is a little bit more context to this regarding the way the US has treated Turkey. They withdrew patriot missile defenses from Turkey and supported the Kurdish forces (PKK & SDF) in northern Iraq and Syria which were fighting with Turkey and firing missiles toward their territory. This led to Turkey purchasing their own missile defenses, the S-400 from the Russians and being kicked out of the F-35 so that system doesn't ""collect"" data on the signature of the S-400.

I personally think this has been a failure of the US foreign policy which made Turkey rather cold towards its NATO allies. Turkey is also rather aggressive for example in its dispute with Greece, which doesn't help the situation.",up19ad

That is to say, we aren‚Äôt infinitely powerful, and we have to think very carefully about our strategic position. If Turkey ends up switching to the Russian side that would be a huge issue.

"It is important to look at how Turkey was in the Syrian war, as Russia has been doing a copy/paste of what it did in Syria, in Ukraine.

In Syria, Turkey bombed Russian artillery. Turkey was very much on everyone side (EU, US, UK, RU & Syria) but it did push back against Russia when it came to need to. 

Turkey since 2016 has been moving away from the West (when it was en route to joining the EU in 2015) and has been playing all sides, as you say, but they are a good ally for the West if a bigger war breaks out.

Russia banned fuel (cannot remember if it is oil or gas) to Finland yesterday which is massive as 97% of Finland gas comes from Russia. Since they got a female prime minister she has been moving away from Russian dependence on gas, but it is still heavily dependent, so maybe Finland will withdraw from NATO application itself if the economic is effected from no fuel. So while Turkey is currently doing its thing, playing every side, right now I don‚Äôt think this is good enough reason to kick Turkey out of NATO. 

At the moment this to me is looking like WW3 and it is not just because of Ukraine. People in the west were asleep and apathetic to China and Russia, who since 2016 were having very public military parades together showing off their weapons. That was them threatening their use of force. When Trump was President of USA (the biggest funder to NATO) the EU realised that they could no longer depend on USA for security. This is when the EU spoke of creating a federal army, to defend Europe from Russia.

This is what the visual really is: in winter the real war will start. China currently is that class bully who encourages the ADHD kid to cause a scene, just so China can see how everyone reacts. Right now Russia economy has not suffered, and after the first week of the invasion of Ukraine Chinas response was that they were going to take Taiwan. So the bigger picture for China is ‚Äòif Russia gets Ukraine then I get Taiwan, and if Russia gets more I get more in the South China sea, maybe Vietnam‚Äô

This will be a real third world war as it will be usa+ eu and hopefully UK plus commonwealth (Australia and NZ) against Russia who has allied with China the way Hitler and Stalin did while they were taking what they wanted, and then became enemies when were the last two standing.

So having Turkey on the West side serves us all here in the West. We don‚Äôt know what side the Arab states or Israel will take. The west and EU and NATO might need Turkey, maybe Turkey will need us. 

So I think in this third war Russia will try to take Afghanistan again and that is why USA pulled out of Afghanistan so quickly and suddenly, because Russia was already sending firing shots to the West (raising gas price, when it supplies to EU, affecting civilians and economy). So if Russia is fighting in Afghanistan, who else would want that land in the region or might want to help Afghanistan against invaders like Russia? Those alliances will be the deciding factor in which way Turkey blows. Could be to Iran, could be to NATO could be to gulf states.. Im not sure.

But in the bigger picture NATO need Turkey on side for when the real war starts this winter.",up19ad
"No, because they are a super power, they are a good partener for NATO.",up19ad
Should we expelled one member who is in NATO for 70 years because of two who decidec only now.? I like Sweden and Finland more than Turkey but in this case Turkey have all rights.

Do you actally want to strengthen Russoa and China?,up19ad
TBF Turkey just want some sort of compensation for accepting Finland and Sweden.,up19ad
">should turkey be expelled from NATO?

Absolutely not.  Turkey is the only Muslim nation that is an ally to the United States as well as a member of NATO.  Their border meets countries like Iraq, Iran, and Syria, so strategically they are vital to the US and NATO for it's location.

Their complaint with Sweden and Finland is this: some Kurdish organizations are recognized as terrorists (the PKK for example) which wants Kurdistan to become an autonomous state and is currently is a part of Turkey.

There have been instances of Swedish courts blocking extradition of known PKK members in the past, giving Turkey the impression that the Swedes have and may continue to, harbor known terrorists.",up19ad
If forced to choose between Turkey and Finland + Sweden the latter win.  But Turkey is large and powerful and it would be a shame to both lose them and push them towards Russia.  So what likely will happen is we will come to some agreement with Finland and Sweden to screw the Kurds AGAIN....for our own reasons.  Not happy about screwing over the Kurds as they're fierce and loyal.  But bet that's what happens as it's already what Erdogan is basically saying he wants (for Finland and Sweden to not recognize them as refugees or presumably help them further at all).  Or perhaps he's trying to put pressure on US about F35s but if so I don't think that shit will fly (pun intended).,up19ad
"Turkey wants to be a mediator between the West and Russia, which is needed. And Turkey is the best country for mediation since they have decent relations with both the West and Russia. Turkey asked to buy Patriot missiles from United States for many years and since the US rejected this request, they had to buy S-400's from Russia. It's no problem when Greece buys S-300's but why is it a problem when Turkey does the same thing? Turkey is also a needed ally in the ME, since they have a large, proffessional, efficent army and they control the straits between Black Sea, Agean Sea and Dardanelles. Furthermore, Turkey fights and have fought proxy wars against Russia in Azerbaijan, Libya and Syria. They are fighting Russia more than any other NATO country. Additionally, Turkey was the first one to arm Ukraine against Russia since this crisis broke out. Their way of arming Ukraine is also the emost efficent since the drone they sold to Ukraine is very cheap and effective. Turkey could be more useful to NATO if both NATO and Turkey would be smarter and helped each other more.",up19ad

"He just found some leverage to get back into the F-35 program or try to. No worries, he will get compensated for lifting his veto if daddy USA decide to.",up19ad
"As a NATO member it is Turkey's right by law to decide whether Sweden/Finnland should join the organization or not. You cannot just expel one (big) member, because he makes use of this right. Apart from that, Turkey has valid reasons to do so: Finnland and Sweden actively support the terrorist organization PKK, which is also internationally recognized as such, within and beyond their borders. In addition to this, we see Greece's hostility towards Turkey, even after Turkey voted for Greece's membership in the NATO. Again, Turkey has valid reasons.

I also want to comment on Russian S-400 case. Turkey has no capable air defense systems apart from various short range stuff and fighting jets. NATO withdrew (nearly?) all Patriot Air Defence batteries from the region and left Turkey defenseless in that regard. Turkey requested NATO countries to sell Patriot and SAMP/T, they didn't. So after all, Turkey wasn't left any other choice but to purchase the S-400.",up19ad
"Strategically they are very important‚Ä¶‚Ä¶but especially with Ergodan is not a reliable partner. They have always been the odd man out due to culture and religious differences. Turkey also has to know that if they distance themselves from Europe, financially it is going to hurt‚Ä¶‚Ä¶and Russia isn‚Äôt going to pick up that slack.",up19ad
"There is a little more to this than what you are seeing and Turkey really isn't as bad as is being made out. Turkey needed an air defense system and  No NATO allies could provide one under agreeable terms. Turkey warned that it needed air defense systems and if a deal couldn't be reached it would have to look outside of NATO. So it ended up buying S-400s from Russia. 

The US and Turkey are at odds sometimes. The US does have a habit of trying to strong arm allies into doing what it wants them to do. Hence the ""puppet government"" that is sometimes applied to allies. Trump did not help matters either in global diplomacy. He bullied allies and was friendly to dictators which worsened diplomatic ties with many countries. 

Turkey is concerned about Finland and Sweden support of terrorist  organizations. From my understanding this is not  ""just rhetoric"" from Turkey. Kurdish Militants are labeled as terrorists from the US, EU, and NATO.  These militants have a direct impact on Turkey  which makes it a high concern to Turkey. 

Turkey supports Ukraine  in this war but it has tried to remain politically neutral, not because it is playing both sides of the fence but because of its position. Turkey is in a unique geographic location in which  it has three general culture sides on its border. You have the European connection, The Middle East connection and then the former Soviet states on its Northeast border. Also there is only about 100 miles of Georgia (a country Russia has been aggressive towards in recent  history) between Turkey and Russia. Turkey, Russia, and Ukraine  also make up most of the shoreline of the Black Sea. 

All of this means that Turkey spends a lot of time playing a diplomatic middle. Europe, Russia, and the Middle East are often at odds and Turkey is the guy in the middle. So Turkey does try to be more cautious in its stances towards other countries. That doesn't mean it supports other countries or ""plays both sides of the fence"". It's survival literally depends on getting along with cultures that have very different regional and world views from each other as it is between all of them. 

Turkey also said they are not saying no to Finland or Sweden. Joining NATO is a process that takes a while. In this process applicants can make changes to meet requirements and work out any diplomatic differences. Turkey has said it is more willing to discuss its concerns with Finland and  Sweden and it is open to them joining, it just isn't ready to give its full support yet. 

So I wouldn't get to annoyed over it. Some of what Turkey is doing is having their hand forced when the US tries to bend ""allies"" to its will and others because its physical location is in a very culturally sensitive position. I am an American by the way. I am not ragging on American bullying as perceived from another country but my own.",up19ad
"In this conflict, it seems like Germany and France are mostly playing ""both sides"". Turkey's drones were a major contribution.

The EU is a mess. Brexit makes a lot more sense now, and look how quickly the UK delivered military equipment? I would not be surprised and actually encouraged if Eastern European countries and Baltic states form their own commonwealth.",up19ad

Yes.,up19ad
"Georgia, Azerbaijan, Armenia, become some big targets for Russia if Finland and Sweden are no longer seen as viable due to NATO membership. That disrupts Turkey's NE border, so, Turkey has to be kinda thoughtful on this.",up19ad
"Turkey is the most questionable country in NATO. Human rights, freedom of press and speech, and their persecution of and conflict with the Kurds. As far as I'm concerned, Turkey out and Finland+Sweden in is an easy choice. Hopefully, they'll be reasonable though.",up19ad

In many respects they are like India in that it is trying to get the best it can out of the East and the West and has issues with both and neither is a clear winning scenario for them.",up19ad
"Ideologically, modern Turkey has no place in NATO, that much is clear. However, strategically it holds such a position that it makes it very hard to imagine kicking it out.
Interestingly, if the Republicans won the next elections in the US, they might end up shifting the American political system so much that the US itself stops having a place in NATO, and therefore NATO itself stops making sense. That alone could entirely explain Putin's attempts to interfere with the US elections in 2016 to help the GOP.

Last week of this clusterfuck showed us all what their hand is atm and it abs shows that they are really mad.. and that‚Äôs it ..,tld5ns
No way.,tld5ns
Russia lost the first Chechen war,tld5ns
"NATO could defeat Russia's air and sea power in one afternoon. No one considers them a near peer...

The sad reality is because of historical reasons they have a legacy nuclear triad system, so no NATO can't just attack them willy nilly. The line is pretty clear : NATO countries. Go in, you die. For the rest it should be : everything short of war.

Realistically, the actions of the West matters little if a revisionist power already decided that war is an option they are willing to take. Look at WW2 : in Europe the Allies appeased Hitler, in Asia the deterrence was a lot more aggressive against Japan. At the end of the day, the fascists attacked regardless, both strategies failed to prevent war.

This time is special though because nuclear war would mean the death of all.",tld5ns
"I‚Äôm sceptical. I think their goal now is to just keep committing war crimes against Ukraine until it agrees to hand Russia the land bridge between Donbas and Crimea. Putin could sell that as a win by claiming he created ‚ÄòNovorussia‚Äô.

But Ukraine have no interest in giving up territory. So I suspect this war will drag on for months.",tld5ns
"I really hope they do. Lol there are 6 carrier strike groups in range of russia in addition to squadrons of allied aircraft and over 150,000 readied at the border. Go for it russia, fucking go for it.",tld5ns
"they can‚Äôt even take Ukraine, why would they attack Poland and feel the wrath of NATO?",tld5ns
"I think Russia may poke a bit at the border to see what happens. Like they do all the time with their airspace invasions. Maybe another drone malfunctions. Something they can deny.

But full scale invasion? No, it would be a humiliating loss and putin would lose the respect of his (few remaining) people. If there's any left by that point.",tld5ns
"Putin doesnt decide anything anymore. He was sneaky and used western greed to his advance. If he involves NATO, he wil only recieve an (Very big conventional) airstrike or two, just to fight him off, no one is interested in full scale war, its not nessesary. The sanctions is poison, its already working. No one will kill the Russian population for god sake no no no, they are victims as well. If Putin infiltrate refugees, well i can speak for Denmark, averybody have their ID checked, photos and fingerprints taken and registred. For obvios and mutiple reasons. Why sholdt he provoke NATO, he just got a hidden, but very very big warning, that escalation would end in a short reaction attack.

Dont think everybody saw it during the chemical weapons debate, but Russian radars could comfirm that something bad could happen in minuttes. Putins call - and he didnt push it :-)

Dont overthink, what ever Putin does from now, there is a plan, and behind that plan a lot of capacity. Sleep tight, dont panic.

If Putin Wins - he lose , and If he lose - he lose. Let time work now.",tld5ns
I'm kinda thinking Poland attacks first at this point ... with Denmark üá©üá∞,tld5ns

"Ukraine is still independent. To me, that‚Äôs winning.",u1b79d
"I view it as a war of attrition at the moment and that usually favours the defender as they nothing left to lose. Russians are beginning to find out just how bad the casualties are getting amongst their soldiers and while Russia doesn‚Äôt value human life including their own nearly as much as the west, it still will erode support at some point, at least I would like to think. 20k KIA is equivalent to 40-50k dead American soldiers and that after just two months. (Adjusting for population) 

How would America feel about potentially losing 300k soldiers plus millions wounded in a year? Look at how much uproar there was over a few thousand over 20 years in Iraq and Afghanistan and 60k over 10 years in Vietnam",u1b79d
they are not winning but they are holding the russians way harder than what russians expected,u1b79d
Ukraine preparing brand new army to take kherson & Nova Kakhova then move towards melitopol thats gonna make largest army of Ukraine released from dombas. rest will be not easy. but we know that Ukraine were fighting against Russia since 2014 and before russian invasion they were about to capture donbas without western support. so they gonna capture it again but it will take time.,u1b79d
"TBD. It's not a football game. Depending on a practically endless number of unknown and potentially uncontrollable factors that will occur as the war goes on, victory for either side is still up in the air. But there's a major russian offensive starting up, so ask again next week.",u1b79d
"Ukraine has defended very hard,it halted the russians first plan so they won that battle but not the war because the war is still going on.

Ukraine trained for this type of warfare and executed it perfectly,but the price has been massive horrible for the civilian population, and destroyed infrastructure.

The new front and new tactics will be alot harder for ukraine to defend against since it changes face now with open fields and more typical russian doctrine war with shorter logistic chains to russia and not the urban warfare that gave ukraine an advantage.

Its not random russia sat down and re-planned it so they will force ukraine out in the open to fight on russias conditions.

the west needs to supply more heavy weaponry nobody knows if that will happen.

Putin might use chemical or nuclear weapons if he is faced with failure on the new front because he might face his own end,if that happens nobody is really sure how it ends,it could turn into ww3.

That said ukraine is fighting as one,nobody is lied to nobody is forced,they fight for each other and their future,because they know the torture rape and death wouldn't stop if putin takes ukraine.

And that is really only how they can win,that is how they win,a future based on democracy with open trade a modern future with freedom to become what you want without fearing being dragged to a gulag or prison or be killed or raped for what you say or think.

To win is to be able to build that future that they want,not what putin want.

And until that happens they can only win battles until the war is over.

I think ukraine can win this because russia is rotted out from the inside and the pressure of war apply to both sides not just the attacked party,the west is trying to even the battlefield as much as it can and its very possible putins world falls apart because its not held together by anything then greed and fear.",u1b79d
"For the Ukraine to win they would need to inflict enough casualties on the Russians to give up.

So far I would say the Ukrainians are winning especially seeing how Russia gave up on Kiev. 

It will be interesting to see this large eastern offensive, if it stalls I‚Äôd say Ukraine is looking good",u1b79d
"Ukraine has seemingly defeated the initial Russian advance according to US defense sources. So with that Ukrsine is winning. Currently

Russia has made very little headway and has even abandoned their attempt to encircle Kyiv giving up ground and being pursued by Ukrainians the entire way. 

But with Aleksandr Dvornikov appointed to oversee the war, new troop movements in Donbas, and few Ukrainian counter assaults outside of Kyiv, this war is far from over.",u1b79d
Ukraine can't win the only goal is to inflect so much damage while the the sanctions start to collapse Russian economy so  That Russia and her allies pull out.,u1b79d
"There are no winners in war.
Insofar as Putin‚Äôs invasion has clearly not gone according to plan it could be argued that Ukraine has the upper hand so far, however despite all their other failings Russians aren‚Äôt stupid and will learn from all the errors they have made so far.  Putin also looks unlikely to back down any time soon, therefore barring any major developments (such as his unexpected death) this could turn into a long, entrenched and bloody conflict.  The supply of defensive weapons to Ukraine is likely to continue, as is Putin‚Äôs willingness to send thousands of young Russian conscripts to their deaths.",u1b79d
It‚Äôs not about who is winning or losing.. the real question is whose losing the most?,u1b79d
"You have to wait... it will be a long war. I doubt at this point that the wast has the capability to stop Putin. Some battles are being winned by Ukranians, some by Russians. Maybe Finland joining NATO or NATO joining the war could change the game. At this point, Ukranians are holding very well, as much as they can, and let's hope they can continue in this way. Russia doesn't care anymore about their economy, in some years we will get rid from their gas at all, and they will be the third world country they deserve to be.
Italy has already made a treaty with Algeria about gas which will cover 1/3 of the russian gas. Russia's already lost. But this doesn't mean that Ukraine will stop to suffer.",u1b79d
"I hate to use the word winning considering how many people have died, but...  
Ukraine's elected government is still in power, of its ten largest cities (that started the 2020 conflict under Ukraine control) Ukraine controls 9 of them and the tenth is currently contested (though likely to fall to the Russians in the near future)  
Russian troops have withdrawn from the North and Northeast of the country to focus on a much smaller area on conquest.   
Technically Ukraine wins as long as they keep fighting as time is on Ukraine's side as sanctions dig in, though time does give Russia time to dig and learn from its mistakes so its not all one sided.",u1b79d

"It is tough, I do think some points have merit but others do not. For example, he essentially contradicted himself. First he mentions the casualty rate of Ukraine and then mentions that no nation can sustain those losses. But, Russia has lost more then 30,000 and has a higher casualty rate than Ukraine. Wouldn't that mean it is not sustainable for Russia?

Secondly, artillery and ammunition i believe is a key issue. Especially ammunition,  there are many issues that are occurring in that respect. But I do believe there is still much more to be gained. From the leasing, I believe US has only supplied so far 10% which means a good amount is left. Secondly, the number of soldiers for Ukraine has increased. Which means atm a lot of the tie-up is with regards to training. I believe south Ukraine will continue to make gains. It is not the quickest but they are consistent. North is the main issue, and hoping with the additional hardware they can hold off until more of Russia runs dry. 

What I'm hoping for is with additional artillery and reports of aircraft, those will turn the tide more heavily towards Ukraine in the north. For sure Ukraine is doing an amazing job at defending and although losing some ground, Russia is suffering severe casualties. If russias momentum slows or supplies further diminish, Ukraine will have the advantage.",vhp5tv
What a muppet. Imagine if you are British or American and someone told you that it‚Äôs lost and to just give up. No chance Dickhead. Get him off the telly. Imagine Britain just giving in to the Germans before the Battle of Britain. Nope. I think the only question is how long can Russia sustain its current offensive before it collapses. And how long can Russias ultimately bleed out in Ukraine before it‚Äôs forced to just go home?,vhp5tv

Another Russian paid shill,vhp5tv
"The casualties are heavy for both sides, and as long as the fire power is not overwhelmingly unbalanced, the final outcome will depend on the will power/resilience of the fighters and command logistics. 

The 100-200 losses/day of soldiers are taking place during the fiercest battle, and those numbers will drop as the battle intensity drops.  Again, if Ukraine can sustain the losses and they are determined to fight this war and win it for their children and future generations, the losses may be worth it even tho it's painful.",vhp5tv

"His tone and speech content scream ""Russian shill"".",vhp5tv
"His comparison to the US losses in the Vietnam war is so dishonest.

For the US to quit the Vietnam war, losses merely had to cross the threshold where they became *unwilling* to fight in some other country's civil war.  For Ukraine to surrender, it has to cross the much higher threshold where they become *unable* to fight.  For Ukraine, this war isn't elective.  They had it thrust upon them where the only other option is ""become a Russian puppet state again"".",vhp5tv

Piss off,vhp5tv
About  Rouble being strong. Yes thats true because western countries are buying resources but russia cannot buy western goods in return so russia cannot spend its foreign currency. Strong rouble is not good for them and they are trying to lower it. Also thats true that soviet caliber artillery ammo is largely depleted but nato provided with their own artillery and ammo.,vhp5tv
"His analysis is flawed and it comes from a way of thinking that most US military officers have been taught which takes in only quantitative data to measure probability of success and neglects intangibles. Had he applied the same reasoning to Vietnam and Afghanistan he would have predicted US victories, but in conflicts of attrition the public will and resolve is the decisive factor. By all accounts Ukraine is prepared to sustain heavy casualties and is in it for the long term, the same can't be said of Russia.",vhp5tv
"Ukraine is using more of the western targeted smart bombs, while vast majority of Russian bombs are dumb bombs. You could shoot 100 dumb bombs and kill 2 people, or you could shoot more accurate smart bombs. I would prefer to shoot the smart bombs any day of the year.

"The man claims that US media is not factual, but then cites US media in this bit of propaganda here?  Not very smart, dude. 

So many times in the history of warfare, people have said the war is lost, but then that's not how it turned out. The battle of Britain is one example, the invasion of Russia by the Nazis is another.

I think the outcome depends on the willingness of the world to support Ukrainian military. As we see Ukrainian military can kick ass just give them enough weapons!

"Fucking nukes. 

It's infuriating. 

If nuclear weapons weren't on the table, NATO would've probably hopped into Ukraine lickety split‚Äîpossibly even actually attacked Russia with SOF in an effort to depose Putin.

However, the counterargument would be that were nukes not on the table, a conventional WWIII could very well break out... 

Tl;Dr: Putin's a cunt and war sucks",tk1kd3
That‚Äôs a stupid idea,tk1kd3

Who‚Äôs we?,tk1kd3
"Winters literally over, now's the time",tk1kd3
"Seriously, NATO and EU have provided lots of financial and equipment aids and helped lots of refugees. Will it be less expensive to take more offensive strategy than defensive one? Not only for the financial loss, thinking about how many civilians were killed in Ukrainian and how many refugees in other countries, it‚Äôs disastrous",tk1kd3
"The undisputed greatest military mind of all time failed miserably invading Russia as have many other great military powers and you think that you, Reddit idiots who cannot stop geo tagging yourselves in real time for updoots (getting yourselves killed by airstrikes) can successfully invade Russia?",tk1kd3
"Can someone finally explain to me how Russia is nazi? But seriously please. Not that typical, moronic ""they're evil, I don't like them so they're nazis"" bullshit.",tk1kd3
"Every nation that tried invading Russia in the past was defeated. Mongols, Swedish 3 times, French twice, turks, germans and Japan. Now please tell me who would dare invade Russia nowadays with an arsenal of 6k nukes?",tk1kd3
"1) Because nukes  
2) It's too big",tk1kd3
We might have to. It‚Äôs clear that if Russia surrenders with 80 percent of their military intact this is still not acceptable. Russias military must be defeated with no chance of a redo for decades. NATO should absolutely get involved and stop the genocide. Anyone who mentions nukes is an NPC at this point.,tk1kd3
"Sure , invade Russia, that will get China troops on Russia side, brilliant",tk1kd3
Because of a little thing called ‚Äúnuclear war‚Äù‚Ä¶?,tk1kd3
"Russia, china, and the USA are pretty much impossible to invade and war between them would probably never be fought in their homelands.",tk1kd3
This is such a dumb take lol,tk1kd3
If this was a good idea it wouldve already happened. The west cant even interfere with the ukrainian airspace without potentially starting WW3. How do you think an invasion of a country thousands of nuclear warheads run by a megalomaniac would end?,tk1kd3
"Go ahead, NATO wont and shouldn‚Äôt help.",tk1kd3
"Lovely idea, but that would start a nuclear war which would destroy the planet. Just Keith Richards and the cockroaches left.",tk1kd3
I feel like some posters on this sub don‚Äôt truly understand what invading Russia would cause. It wouldn‚Äôt be some back and forth ground war like in ukraine. It would be total world annihilation most likely. Crazy to see so many posts advocating for this.,tk1kd3
What a spicy take üôÑ,tk1kd3
"Even without nukes, everyone is forgetting the millions Russia could muster in reserves. This would not be an easy war for nato as some think, as the Russians defending their homeland would have much better morale and reason to fight than they do now. NATO would still win (without nukes) but it would be costly. 

Now op for suggesting this why don‚Äôt you fly out to Ukraine and fight the Russians? If your so eager to see the world go into nuclear war, why don‚Äôt you start and head over there.",tk1kd3
You would need to dismantle their ability to launch nukes from every location. And many of them are still secret. We can‚Äôt be sure they won‚Äôt follow through with mutually assured destruction without doing it internally WITH their government. Diplomacy is a bitch,tk1kd3
"After you sir, il be there in 5min. Dont wait up :)",tk1kd3
Because they have nukes,tk1kd3
"Great plan, but I am allergic to nuclear fall out.",tk1kd3
I would be apart of that Campaign. We could take them. They don‚Äôt have the same nuclear capability as U.S. I have more bias towards the greatest country. I mean we aren‚Äôt perfect but we have freedom. I would attack Russia just on principle fuck them and Putin. Semper Fi üá∫üá∏,tk1kd3
Okay you go first.,tk1kd3
"Go to your local Ukrainian embassy, they are hiring mercs, no joke.",tk1kd3
Napolean and Hitler tried that with disastrous outcomes and that was without the world largest nuclear arsenal potentially in play. Nah.,tk1kd3
Pushing them out of Ukraine and crippling them financially and militarily is the goal. You invade Russia they will launch what shitty nukes that actually work and don‚Äôt blow up on their own soil. Causing nuclear winter and killing us all. Bad scenario.,tk1kd3
Clogging the feed with bullshit hypotheticals,tk1kd3
"After witnessing the lockdowns and mandatory style of the UK and US and Canada I think we have our own Nazi socialist ideology in full swing.
There's definitely a whiff of Socialist tyranny in all countries involved with the davos elite.
From Russia and China to Canada and Australia and the EU countries that obey macron and Merkel who were all students of davos.
We are not going to like what comes next.",tk1kd3
Who is we? Not the US. I‚Äôm not interested in a nuclear war.,tk1kd3

Ukraine is taking volunteers.,t6x18u
Go fight then.,t6x18u
"You must try to better appreciate the sensitivity of the issue my fellow American. Are you an enlisted in one of the branches of our military? If the answer is no, then please enlist before saying something like we should send ‚Äúour‚Äù troops over. You have no idea what it is like to be involved in the horrors of war. Although I agree with your sentiment I do not agree with your answer of manpower. You think stoking that fire is a good idea? Please think of the innocent lives that will be at risk due to the escalation of violence if the US were to involve themselves/and the other NATO countries. This is an atrocious thing the war in Ukraine. I have seen so much death this past week and I‚Äôm just as sickened as you are. But more death is not the answer. At least not yet it isn‚Äôt. We have to try our best to squeeze Putins grasp off of the Ukrainian people by way of diplomacy, not attrition. I have the rage inside of me that you feel but as a man in another country I am only able to watch on and hope for the best. If you want to send someone over there, go yourself. Do not wage war with hands of others. The second Russia attacks us or a close ally the story will be different. Please just hope, pray, believe, that things will be better for the world. Do not stoke the fire that has the potential to burn the world down. I feel your pain. And please think about those lives you would so willingly send over into hell. It is easy to point and watch from afar. If you were the one dodging bullets, you might sing a different tune.",t6x18u

"Americans should not be speaking on this topic.

"""When all else fails, send the troops."" Firstly, all else hasn't failed, yet. There is a lot being done already, by many countries, groups and individuals, to help the Ukrainians. Sure, I would love it if NATO could just go in and show Putin what-for, but as awful as the war in Ukraine is right now, it's nothing compared to what a third world war with potential nuclear conflict would be like. Keep this in mind.",t6x18u
I was right with you as of last week but digging into this 2014 war in Donetsk etc. I‚Äôm not quite sure what to believe and I‚Äôm not ok with American lives being lost over a dispute no one who is sent over understands.,t6x18u
">However these images coming out of Ukraine are heartbreaking

Then don't look at them. Switch off.


>If we sit by and do nothing then we are almost as bad as those perpetrating these attacks.

No, Americans are not as bad as those. Americans do sell weapons to Saudi Arabia to bomb Yemen, which so far has killed hundreds of thousands in a famine. There, the contribution is more direct.

>When all else fails send the troops. 

Let me.save you the troubles and start with nuclear weapons

>I know the stakes are high but anyone who can sleep peacefully at night after seeing these images need not apply

"Idk my left foot from my right but I imagine that unfortunately, the entire value that comes from being a part of NATO is that you benefit from direct ‚Äúboots on the ground‚Äù assistance in war.

Dude might as well send Putin the coordinates to house for the first strike ^^^ foh,t6x18u
I'm willing to contribute. However I'm not sure how much help a out of shape middle-aged guy would provide but I'm willing to contribute to the cause. Maybe I  can make the ribbons to put on trees in support of the troops. J/k I'm sure we have plenty of able bodied troops that would volunteer to go. There are soldiers in the service that have trained for this and are itching to be in the fight.,t6x18u
Then go and enlist in the Russian army to end the war sooner,t6x18u
"Edmund Burke said that 

Give him some credit",t6x18u
I get what you're saying. It's hard..ar what point do we not allowed dictators to destroy countries and kill people. I hate to just watch and I understand how it could make things worse to get involved. What I think we should do is not going after them as a whole military but take just putin out as a solo mission somehow.,t6x18u
"Only Putin needs to die, not a lot more people.

I fully support sending Lindsey Graham strapped with explosives on an assassination mission.",t6x18u
"See that's the thing: **we already did nothing**.  Now there are no good options. We can't send our troops into direct conflicts with Russia -- that ends the world.  But all the same, Russia can't send their troops into direct conflict with us. You really think Putin would have crossed the border if there were US troops waiting for him on the other side? And anyway, we didn't even need to go that far. We have robust anti-air and anti-missile systems. We know how to arm a country so it can defend itself against a modern adversary.  We didn't do that though. We could have, but it's too late now.

Edit: a word",t6x18u
"If you want that, then go and volunteer. They‚Äôre accepting foreign fighters. I, for one, am pretty happy not being drafted to fight in ww3, and I don‚Äôt want my country to enter yet another costly war for a country that doesn‚Äôt actually benefit us in any way.

Like a school argument of ""Well I could of done this but my excuse is this"".

The comedy seeps in from the fact that I don't think they understand themselves why it isn't going well at all and they are, as they speak, trying to confirm their views and agreement with other guests on this show.

Also preaching to the choir effect. I mean sure there are shows in every country where there is mostly one sided people on the panel but come on - even radical left/right shows bring on guests from other viewpoints. Here it seems they are all ""arguing"" from the same point and trying to twist the same old rhetoric. I would really like to see some ""opposition"" or counter views.

"The problem here is that ultimately, a constitution is a piece of paper. It is worthless without anyone to enforce it.

In the US, given congress votes for it, jail time for an impeached president could happen. Wether congress votes in a proper manner is another thing, but its still possible

In russia, putin has a tight grip around many power structures. If anyone who is in a position to be able to start the impeachment process, they will find themselves dead soon after. Words on a sheet of paper no longer matter when you know that you will die trying to invoke it.
Even if there are enough votes for impeachment and prison times, those who voted yes will find themselves """"""comitting suicide by 37 stab wounds to the back, shot in the back of the head twice, bound and gagged and jumped from a window""""""

I hope one day I am able to travel to Ukraine and meet folks and express my admiration and gratitude to one and all.  

He is not alone in his concern and fear for the future, I am as well.  Every day I look at the news and try to find solace in positive news coming out.

Ukraine wanted this to get in EU? Ukraine didn't started this war. I understand his anger, but the invasion was going to happen anyway, before or after. And Ukraine knew about this, they was begging all the world to put sanctions on Russia months and months before the invasion started.

"When you have a population like the Urkainians fighting for their country, occupation Wars can only be lost. If the west continues to support Ukraine, and Ukraine doesn't lose it's appetite for the east. There is no way Russia holds the regions they invaded. And as in the past, Russia will collapse in on itself like the USSR cause they don't know when to quit. History doesn't repeat itself but it sure does rhyme. Russia cannot outspend the west, and cannot win a war against a 150,000 trained, and 20 million untrained people if they keep getting weapons and food. Russia will run out of both before Ukraine",tta6hr

As a Finnish I suggest you check the map for the borders of Finland. Russia never conquered those parts colored on grey blue. Those areas have been Finland's ever since we gained our independence. But there are other parts on Karelian isthmus near St Petersburg and Petsamo by the Arctic Ocean that belonged to Finland before peace treaty of 1940.,v34xdj

"I don't mean to be unkind, but this is very much a Paradox game player's understanding of how the world works. This kind of collapse is quite silly and utterly unrealistic (in what world are ethnically Russian principalities conquered centuries ago going to split from a Russian polity just because they technically used to be different entities?). Geopolitics of any kind appear to be completely ignored, as there's very little rational reason that four separate states would be set up east of the Urals given how strategically and economically weak they'd be.

Similarly, there's little reason to believe that Norway, a liberal democracy, would have any interest whatsoever in random and almost certainly unstable expansionism into Russia. If you're playing a game with simplified parameters that encourage expansion at any cost, then sure that works, but in the real world expansion of that kind would be incredibly difficult and contentious. Imagine the nightmare of trying to account for a population increase that would be in the order of *25%*. All of these people have to be surveyed, integrated into legal and institutional systems, and so forth - it could never be worth the cost for Norway.

It also appears to have much too concrete an idea of exactly how spaces would be divided up and what they would be named - how can we know that one bit of Siberia will call itself the ""Siberian Republic"" and another the ""Far Eastern Republic""? These factors are incredibly hard to predict ahead of time, even when a collapse of this kind is likely - which I don't think it is in this case. Neither is it clear why borders are drawn in such a precise manner.

Finally, I think there's some na√Øvet√© about both the justness and good sense of something like this. Even if it were realistic to implement - which it isn't, objectively - it would almost certainly be against the wishes of a very large segment of the involved populations. Is this ethical? It'd also almost certainly collapse into strife very rapidly, causing considerable avoidable suffering, which seems at best counterproductive. Again, in games in which civilians are just numbers, this doesn't matter, but we're talking about the real world here, in which civilians are humans and humans matter.",v34xdj

Mari republic and other republics have been completely ignored (probably the author didn't even know about this). Also why the hell is Finnish area marked as going back to Finland, even it's already now part of Finland.

As much as Russia as a state deserves severe punishment, I don't believe this is the way to go. I'm imagining something akin to the United States of Russia. Some of the minorities republics in the Urals, Siberia Caucasus and possdibly the far north of European Russia might prefer to secede, but I'm not really sure about that either.",v34xdj

There are Russians like Navalny who have done everything they could to prevent the war and thousands of people who went on demonstrations. There are also thousands of people who temporarily left the country and now are doing everything  to take the reins away from Putin. 

It's like ok, if you Ukranians really mean what you say about 'killing all the Russians' and partitioning my country then go on. Then probably Putin has a grain of truth in his words when he calls you Nazis.",v34xdj

I mean yeah sounds great but what would have to happen for such disintegration to happen?",v34xdj
Yeah lets just let Russia stew in its pre 2014 borders. This is exactly what Putin wants. An invasion scare ( even if it was just aiding and abetting internal strife) will just give Russian population a justification.,v34xdj

"Maybe because of talk such as this post, have the Russians reacted the way we see now in Ukraine? Offense best defense? Again, this is a point of discussion before I get crucified here by the board, however there are a lot of plays going behind so called closed doors that us regular people don‚Äôt have access to.  It is very possible that there was a movement encouraged by the west even before the invasion, in order to facilitate the breakup of Russia.
As far as Russia breaking into different parts, would take Russia to be very weak, and for various minorities to feel confident to go ahead and start some form of rebellion in order to secure greater autonomy or independence.
Personally , having met a lot of Russians that are different ethnicities , but however see themselves as Russian, makes me think the above would be very tough as Russia has done a good job in assimilating ethnic groups. A great example is how probably half of Chechnya is pro-Russia.",v34xdj
"By this logic, whats Finland? Its all Sweden mate.",v34xdj
"This reminds me of all the reddit posts about China exploding in 30 thousands different countries, except all of these maps are bonkers and don‚Äôt represent realities, Russia collapsing would see a handful of ethnic republics splitting and that would be the end of it, i can also say that Ukraine is gonna collapse into 67 cossacks hetmanates because 14th century history, seriously get a life this is just ridiculous",v34xdj

There's nominal Congressional oversight (reports sent to committees), but, basically it's just up to the administration to spend the funds wisely. In particular, the $8.7B economic support fund can be sent directly to the Ukrainian government; they just have to write a memo explaining what it's for. It really doesn't seem crazy to me to demand more rigorous oversight for how all this money is being spent. For context, $40B is almost 7x Ukraine's entire military budget. It's 2/3 the amount of Russia's entire military budget. It's 25% of Ukraine's *entire GDP*. It's a lot of money to be throwing around with minimal oversight in any context, but as applied to Ukraine specifically it's an *insane* amount.",upb72n

At some point we need to realise that freedom must be fought for and defended. Those that think we can just sit back in the free world and let then get in with it are as much a problem as those that actively make excuses for these despotic regimes.

"Good.  We‚Äôre sending billions and billions of our tax money to Ukraine while in our own country people can‚Äôt afford food, and can‚Äôt find baby formula",upb72n
Why does this make him pro Russia when the US has so many serious things to worry about for itself? Seems like people are just mad over nothing..,upb72n
He has a point though. We are giving them money we don't have. We can't save the world if we collapse.,upb72n

Considering how much we have given already and America being in a recession how about you all say thank you for doing what America can and be grateful you keyboard idiots. American war tech has turned the war by allowing infantry to combat air and found armor.,upb72n
"It's not about lobbying Russia, it's about the US giving away a lot of money amidst inflation, supply shortages, border crises, etc.",upb72n
In his speech he said he thinks it‚Äôs ludicrous to send another 40 billion in aid when we could use that money here . That‚Äôs enough money to fix every major highway in the US /,upb72n
"Nobody heard a word this man said.

He‚Äôs about as principled as it comes to accountability and oversight, and our government has a history of mismanagement. He‚Äôs making a stand to try to squeeze in such oversight, knowing a delay of a couple of days will occur - but also in full support of passing this spending for Ukraine.

People are dying in Ukraine and days are critical. It‚Äôs fair to call Paul‚Äôs move a mistake. But FFS, the hyperbole is misplaced and unproductive.",upb72n
People have a problem with him not wanting to aid a war the US isn't apart of. Maybe cause America isn't taking care of it's own people first. The US government doesn't care what happens to soldiers the moment they become veterans.  They don't care one bit about the homeless population that keeps growing due to the governments own bad policies and sending money to other countries.  Yet people want the government to fund other countries and get involved in wars that don't directly involve the US from the beginning. How about no until the US fixes it's own problems?,upb72n
"He‚Äôs a true libertarian of the US kind. No money for foreign aid or interventions. He follows his father, Ron Paul, who is known as Dr No because he would always reject publicly funding anything except essential services. Some might think it an honourable position. I don‚Äôt agree with it. I see it as an extremism that‚Äôs cost lives in the USA and abroad. Rand Paul‚Äôs stance on Ukraine proves it.",upb72n
He's actually a Libertarian... They oppose all foreign war and most government spending.,upb72n
"He wants some accountability for the $ 30 BILLION in US aid to Ukraine so that Ukraine can defend its borders. 

At the same time, the US Southern border is completely open and no one has any idea who gets over the US border (illegals, Muslim terrorists??).

The US has a budget deficit of $ 30 TRILLION while the US hands over $ 30 BILLION like it is $$ we found in the couch cushions.",upb72n
"Please try to understand why. He is not again supporting Ukraine. He is against blank checks to the US government during a time of inflation.

He wouldn‚Äôt have opposed the bill if it was more sensible",upb72n
He also looks like a complete bell end.,upb72n

"Oversight is needed. Ok, fine. Let's assume there's absolutely no oversight. Rand Paul is now going to be leading the oversight committee and make sure that every dollar is accounted for, and he'll sleep peacefully at night. Secondly, and more importantly, shit can be done in parallel ... you could start the process of transferring the money and letting them at least start placing the orders and not interrupt military aid. While this is happening, and it's not going to happen overnight, Rand Paul and all the other morons can set up as much oversight as they want.

All other options cause unnecessary delays and human toll and suffering. Rand Paul and his supporters are going to have a lot of blood on their hands. 

If you have so little trust in your government to be able to handle 40 billion dollars (3x less than the quarterly revenue of Amazon) , while Elon Musk is jerking around SEC for the same amount of money... Maybe the corruption problem isn't in Ukraine?",upb72n

The amount of oversight that goes into foreign aid is already insane. He just wants to sound principled.,upb72n
"I'm glad that the world is having a look into what libertarianism is. For anyone not American, this guy is against anything that isn't associated with the aid of America. Back when the US was figuring out if Montenegro should join NATO, Rand was vocal AF saying things like ""we gain nothing by letting Montenegro into NATO and they gain everything"". McCain called him an agent of Moscow. 

Personally I think the man means well, he's just misguided as to how his constituents feel. I've yet to meet an American who didn't support Ukraine entirely. Most Americans (the ones I've met at least) agree on the loan and lease act as well as direct military intervention for Ukraine. Rand only speaks for like 10% of the country right now. But remember, even in 1939 America, there were Nazis amassing in MSG, NY.",upb72n
He doesn't represent Americans.  He is an example how Russia has infiltrated the US government.,upb72n
"I wish Redditors had a better grasp on the concept of ""principled opposition"".

Not everyone who opposes you is motivated by the most evil reasons imaginable.

Paul has always resisted US government spending on foreign wars, and when such has been absolutely necessary, has advocated strong control and oversight on how that money is spent. One need only look at the staggering amount of money wasted on absolute corruption in Iraq and Afghanistan to understand why; once you let the pigs get their snouts in the trough of war spending, they gobble it all up.

This is the role he plays in our political system; he's the guy who doesn't just greenlight spending our rent money on bullets, and resists the urge to build an empire of American influence. You have to have such people to keep the system honest, even if you disagree with the direction we ultimately need to take.",upb72n
I would not include Rand Paul when discussing civilized folks. And he‚Äôs full Russian.,upb72n
"On the surface, his delaying tactic looks completely reasonable.  ""We want an Inspector General to oversee the spending.""

Only problem is, when Congress agreed that this was a reasonable item to discuss RIGHT THEN, Paul refused to proceed.  Thus forcing a further delay, even when the addition he proposed had its most likely chance of succeeding.

The ONLY way that makes sense is if Paul was deliberately trying to stall the appropriation, rather than overseeing how it is administered.  And as the only entity that benefits from such a delay is Russia, there is only one entity Paul could be forcing the delay for.",upb72n

The fact of the matter is that 40 billion is going to Ukrainians to help kill more humans. The last 100 years more humans have lost their lives in war than all the wars before combined.  History will look back over this time period and will say this time period is the darkest and most evil time in human history. I support Ukraine 100% I have and will continue to donate as much as I can. These politicians in the USA they don't donate their money they steal it from the American people by force threw the IRS if necessary and they decided who receives it. Ukrainians must look at what happen in Afghanistan it very well could be your future. Remember our government has no issues turning their back on anyone once they have lined their own pockets and the motivation has been lost. Endless wars is the game politicians in this country strive for. At the end of the day Ukraine may be better off without signing their soul over to the rinos and democrats of the USA.

Enough of us care for our government (many in both parties) to keep sending help to Ukraine.,xtrt7r
After all my years being alive I came to a shocking conclusion that most of the people are morons. And that scares me,xtrt7r
Billions of US tax payer dollars are going to Ukraine and there isn't really an outspoken protest against it.  I'd call that a win not press the issue.,xtrt7r
For me this is Cold War 2.0. I spent the first 30 years of my life with the sort of feeling that Russia was going to end the world any moment. Some people will never get this nor care. I can just see as the bombs fall that there will be influencers trying to figure out where to get their nails done and why they can‚Äôt seem to upload to TikTok.,xtrt7r
"I think the problem is that there are so many ""emergencies"" were supposed to care about that it's difficult not to be apathetic to... All of it.

And I am an American who cares about this and has been following closely fwiw.",xtrt7r

Many Americans are still brainwashed by Trump who repeatably told them that Russia is not their enemy,xtrt7r
"People care, they might not be as...enthusiastic with their support as some here. For example my wife doesn't talk much about the war unless something major happens like the annexation and even then it is a brief conversation. But she cares about it.  She donates regularly to support Ukraine in some way, Usually a couple of times a month. She also buys digital items off verified Ukrainians. But she is very low key about it. Half the time i don't know she has donated until weeks later.

I am more vocal about it and i follow it more closely and root openly for Ukraine daily. I also support financially but less than she does. So our support is different  and not always obvious. But i wouldn't say she supports Ukraine less than me by any means even though mine is more obvious to a third party.

Remember people have problems in their daily lives they must deal with. Inflation is a big issue across the world. Problems that directly affect people right now will get most of their attention. It doesn't mean they don't support Ukraine. It just means they have a life they still have to live and problems they still have to solve.",xtrt7r
"I think people who lived in the 1980s are a little more concerned as we grew up watching the ""Day After"" as one of our ""after school specials.""

I just wish the The world collectively would realize how important it is to defeat Russia now while they‚Äôre bleeding.",xtrt7r
"Honestly without major day to day changes most people just don't have the capacity or interest into following the day to day grind of the war.  I don't really expect people that are not directly involved to have knowledge of territorial gains which were at a near stalemate until last week.  Recent situations like the pipeline bombing and nuclear chicken are well covered in US media at least.

What really matters is your government is taking most of the right steps and that the people support Ukraine.  I'm still baffled by the amount of tankies and far right idiots that support Russia.

The fact is, most people are living their lives. Also, to be fair, most of us have little to no influence over this. I care an awful lot about these issues, but that mostly results in me being anxious. 

Sure, I can try to dispel fake news. Or raise awareness. But most people don‚Äôt have any real influence beyond voting every few years. I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs reasonable to expect everyone to invest their limited time and emotional energy in something they can‚Äôt influence.",xtrt7r

People just don't care, until it hits them on the face.",xtrt7r
"Please stop this, the Americans care more than anyone and they are doing more than anyone for the war effort.

The way to get more support out of people for the war isn‚Äôt to shame them for not caring it‚Äôs to show them what going on, the only people who are gonna react to ‚ÄúYou guys aren‚Äôt doing or caring enough‚Äù are the people who think that the government is doing too much and will use your statements to push their agendas of no longer supporting Ukraine for how ungrateful everyone seems about their support.",xtrt7r
"I wish more people were keeping themselves informed, for sure. I have a handful of podcasts and YouTubers (with info from reliable sources) that I‚Äôve used to keep up, and I listen to updates daily. There are a few people in my immediate social circle who are very informed, and I‚Äôm sure there are many vocal folks like the ones in this thread. 

Beyond that, I‚Äôve mostly heard ‚Äúwhy are we sending billions of dollars of aid to Ukraine?! America first!‚Äù They don‚Äôt take the time to understand that:

1. we have an opportunity to help defeat our biggest enemy‚Äôs military without losing a single American soldier

2. This war is being fought with a *lot* of American weapons ‚Äî and Ukraine is *winning*. The world is watching. They‚Äôre seeing how effective American weapons are. It will generate trillions in weapons and defense contracts. These billions in aid will pay for themselves easily. 

3. it‚Äôs the right thing to do. As Americans, we like to thump our chests and bellow about ‚ÄúFREEDOM!‚Äù
and that‚Äôs fine, that‚Äôs what we‚Äôre all about (in theory). But we can‚Äôt see past the tips of our noses and understand that we are strong enough to fight for freedom wherever it is threatened. The allied relationship between the US and Ukraine now will yield valuable advantages for generations. Many Americans simply don‚Äôt take the time to understand how it‚Äôs going to benefit us in the long run.",xtrt7r
"I think you‚Äôre right. Thing is with conflicts for most people: the closer to home, and the more they identify with the people affected by conflicts: the more they care. 

That‚Äôs why most European countries care, and will take in Ukrainian refugees by the boat loads. They don‚Äôt care the same way about Middle-Eastern and African refugees. It‚Äôs just the way the mind works.

I‚Äôm not saying that‚Äôs OK, but that‚Äôs how it works in people minds.

Looking at post-Soviet countries that are neighboring Russia; they are going all-in with their support for Ukraine. They remember what it‚Äôs been like living under Russia‚Äôs rule, and they don‚Äôt want to go back to that.",xtrt7r
"Bro, I'm in Montreal, Quebec (Canada)... even my most ""into politics"" friends don't care anymore.",xtrt7r
I am an American as well and it does concern me that so many do not grasp the gravity of this war. I know there is deep support for Ukraine but it bothers me that the crimes committed by Russia are not covered more extensively by the main stream media. If 1 American soldier was treated as Russia has been treating civilians let alone the Ukrainian POW‚Äôs the US would plant its foot so far up Putin‚Äôs ass he would have a shoe leather smile.,xtrt7r
"same here, I'm an American and I think it's the number 1 priority to defeat Putin, but everyone else I know doesn't care if Ukraine is eliminated, and they don't want to spend any money on defending Ukraine",xtrt7r
you are my friend,xtrt7r
"I literally just said the same thing to a friend yesterday:

What worries me more is that the US public isn‚Äôt taking this seriously enough.

In 1983, this would be front-page news everywhere and people would be fully aware of the peril.

Nowadays,‚Ä¶ meh. Back to social media memes.",xtrt7r
"The world has already changed dramatically towards de-globalized regions. COVID and now Ukraine just accelerated it. Your neighbors probably just don't realize it. 

Don't be too judgemental. Most people in the world are the same.",xtrt7r
"What difference does it make if a bunch of random Americans care or not? People only have energy to focus on so many things, which are usually things that immediately affect them. The right Americans understand, so we send more aid than any other country. Most everyday people aren‚Äôt really itching to talk about geopolitical situations that don‚Äôt affect them and that they can‚Äôt affect by simply discussing.",xtrt7r
May I ask what region of the US you live? I‚Äôm in the northeast and there are Ukrainian flags in support of Ukraine on several houses and businesses. And I am not in an area where there are a lot of Slavic people.,xtrt7r
"I am watching it, closely. Commenting and bought a shirt from Saint Javelin. I am a former submariner who remembers our rivalry with the Soviets. Slavi Ukraini.",xtrt7r
"Same here in France. Because Ukraine is a poor country, and in a capitalist world most peoples only care about the rich and dgaf about poor peoples who struggle to survive.",xtrt7r
I mean I care. I want Ukraine to win.,xtrt7r
Well about half the people I worked with were initially supportive of the Russian invasion.   They ate up the propaganda pushed by Russia in US right-wing media.  They just slowly became silent over the months.,xtrt7r
And Europeans don‚Äôt give a shit either.  I have been traveling the American south west the last week. More Europeans than Americans are at the parks right now. So it‚Äôs really humans don‚Äôt care,xtrt7r
Too many are in bed with the Russians to care.,xtrt7r
We aren't war mongering enough for y'all now? Lol,xtrt7r
Well hardly do American voices matter at all but the people in charge. But the fall of Ukraine might be a great distraction from Afghanistan. Russians make a good enemy. And our people see our help as the only reason Ukraine is still around.,xtrt7r
"Life goes on while a war goes on elsewhere. The cost of living is more of a concern from what I‚Äôve heard. Only half of conservatives would back Ukraine. Some are honestly pro-Russia. From what I‚Äôve seen, it seems those that are secretly pro-Russia have tuned out of the war and have moved onto other topics such as domestic issues which may include cost of living. 

I hope Ukraine wins. And even if many people are not tuned in, we‚Äôre still here.",xtrt7r
"That‚Äôs not true at all, we may not be vocal about it but we definitely care.",xtrt7r
"I'm one of the few in my circle who follow it closely. My friends know I follow it and occasionally ask about it. 
I agree, more folks need to take notice of what's really going on",xtrt7r
"It's a heavy topic. It's hard to come out of the blue and overwhelm people with politics. I'm sure enough people care, but not just in your community.",xtrt7r
"I‚Äôm right there with you, buddy. I have NO ONE with whom to discuss this war. No one pays attention. I‚Äôm a longtime student of history and I‚Äôve seen the horrendous things that humans continue to do to one another. I love my children and want them to live long lives‚Ä¶ but if humanity goes down to extinction in a fireball soon‚Ä¶ I‚Äôll know we had it coming, and the universe will go on without us.",xtrt7r
Same here the only other person following the war is my 71 year old grandfather and he gets his news from the main stream media which is like a day or two late on coverage and the stuff I follow is with hours of not minutes of it and the things he‚Äôs telling me is so watered down to the stuff I tell him this whole thing sucks I‚Äôm just glad that being a boy scout has taught me to be prepared for anything if possible and I feel like if WW3 were to happen I‚Äôd be somewhat prepared to help my family and friends of possible.,xtrt7r
"I care about this war. I worry a lot about my kids of military age called upon if the US and Europe enters this war. The winter also worries me because Putin will feel more cornered and pressured to use a nuke. The people who don‚Äôt care have their minds on some other things like Tik Tok and so on. Others just care more about their personal interests in daily life society (until it hits). Just like many people‚Äôs reaction about hurricane Ian. In my job life goes on as normal, people talk about celebrities or other bs nonsense, but if it was our city affected in the aftermath of such catastrophic events they would be so worried (imagine just their cellular services not working)",xtrt7r
"Personally I am worried about what could happen after the next US presidential election.  The fighting should be over by then, but I don't expect the war will be officially over (including agreeing reparations, fate of war criminals,  Russian demilitarisation, etc). If Trump or a Trump acolyte takes control, they might want to cut a deal with Putin that screws over Ukraine. I pray that doesn't happen.",xtrt7r
"People, especially Americans, have short attention spans. Most people worry about their individual families, lives and changes in it, good or bad. Just as the Ukrainians paid attention to Syria when the Russians were there. It didn't dominate their lives. Our government does not. Supporting Ukraine with weapons is a cheap way to avert a major world war. It would cost the world far more to fight Russia in Poland and the Baltics where a nuclear exchange would be far more likely to occur. That is why the Ukrainians are fighting for us all.",xtrt7r
Americans feel this war can't touch them so they go about their day without a thought about the atrocities to mankind happening in Ukraine. As ppl we should have sympathy and empathy and care about the ppl of Ukraine,xtrt7r
"Not spelling enough correctly, in a post criticizing your fellow Americans for not carring 'enough' is like the truest American thing I've seen since Trump left office.",xtrt7r
"Email your congresspeople. It took me all of 10 minutes this spring to find their email addresses and send them all the same message. What really matters is who is giving what message to Congress, so use your voice for what you can.

"Americans have a toxic positivity problem. See no evil, hear no evil, speak no evil. Many of us are programmed at work to be positive all the time. Positive to our friends all the time. We don‚Äôt want to talk about ‚Äúicky‚Äù reality. We sanitize the food we eat‚Ä¶. Disconnected from slaughter and discomfort. We rarely see death. We have created a bubble and it‚Äôs made us weak and helpless. We have developed apathy. We bridge this feeling with consumption: too much food, entertainment and other coping mechanisms. 

The majority of people I know just work all the time and bury their head in the sand during their free time. 
These are my opinions.",xtrt7r
"It is a sad state of affairs that people only seem to care about what affects them now. Then the same people complain when it starts to affect them with words like ""why didn't anybody warn us?""",xtrt7r
"Where is the EU?  Why is the USA the world police?  And by the way, they Europeans hate us til they need our money and protection.",xtrt7r
"I agree Americans have their head in the sand about it. This war could easily (and may already) have the largest world implications since world war 2. We let the Britain‚Äôs fight Hitler solo for years before we got pushed in to the at the expense of being attacked first (Pearl Harbor). We are in a proxy war with communism, and it could easily turn in to a fight to the death we psycho Putin. I generally favor the Republican Party but they are being soft AF in fear that helping Ukraine gives Biden any sort of luck come November ‚Äò24. It‚Äôs so soft to let politics steer the safety of our country/the world. Slava Ukraini",xtrt7r

"Care? if you ain't doing anything about it your care doesn't mean shit.

Simply people with lives, which understood that they can't do anything about it blow it of yea. I can't do anything about it, but i can live my life in peace, till it doesn't affect me ofc and then i still can't do anything about it and ill find a way through it.",xtrt7r
"Same in Canada, in fact a lot of Poles living here are pro Putin for whatever reason completely ignoring the history of Russian governments ruling over eastern europe. Instead they don't care or go on anti usa rants.",xtrt7r
"Ask them if they've seen the movie Red Dawn. If so, tell them that Ukraine is the Wolverines and Zelensky is Patrick Swayze.",xtrt7r
Not surprising...during the 1st Gulf war most US university students couldn't find Kuwait on a map...this is what happens when nations have the attention span of a gnat,xtrt7r
"If I bring it up people usually say, ""that's still happening?"" It's sad how short the attention span of the average American is.",xtrt7r
Simple out of sight out of mind..,xtrt7r
I suspect most Americans only care about bullshit things. A great lack of empathy and compassion but it can't be too bad because the fascists haven't taken over yet. There seems an intentional ignorance on the part of so many. At times I suspect a belief that video games are reality and Kardashians are greatness. The war in Ukraine is fought for the freedoms so many in the USA talk about but take for granted.,xtrt7r

"Honestly as a US citizen I do care but wtf can we do about it. When this first started I was working Night Shift and saw Russia invade Ukraine hella violently and then my phone service went out. I almost had a anxiety attack and was threatening to go home bc I‚Äôm not dying at work! (I thought nukes were going off and basically cellular towers got EMPed) my phone service came back on and everything was all good. 

After that moment though I realized being stressed and freaking out about something I have no control over is just not worth the stress. I know it seems like the end of the world but when you turn off social media and stop watching the news, the actual reality around you isn‚Äôt as world ending as you think. Just take everything you see on here w a grain of salt. A lot of propaganda going around on both sides, and if it‚Äôs causing you to freak out then just take a break. Only worry about things you can control",xtrt7r
"I'm on disability, but I still donate what little I can.  This does not make me a great human being.  I'm simply saying, we should all care enuf to support Ukraine in whatever way we can.",xtrt7r
We have a very short attention span,xtrt7r
"The joint chiefs of staff know exactly what‚Äôs going on. Biden and Blinken hate bullies and committed to Ukraine before the invasion. 

The masses may not be paying much attention because there‚Äôs nothing to influence. A better indicator of American sentiment might be that there have been lots of demonstrations to support Ukraine but none for Russia.",xtrt7r
"I would say in a way we care too much, us caring and trying them

"Not really much people can do half a world away.  No point in banging your head against the wall driving yourself mad.  America has done more than anybody to arm and support Ukraine.

Total respect to the brave people in Ukraine! I think a lot of Americans don‚Äôt fully understand the horrors of a potential nuclear war. I grew up during the Cold War and I know how quickly an exchange of tactical battlefield nukes could quickly escalate into a full blown nuclear war that could destroy all life on earth in a matter of days. Sadly there‚Äôre a lot of people who don‚Äôt understand that concept.,xtrt7r
"We tried it a few times, is this your first rodeo?",xtrt7r
If you speak the way you type you are probably horrible to listen to.,xtrt7r
"It's just a conflict far far away and it doesn't have an influence of the daily living of an US citizen. Who cares about some war as example in Africa ?

Another thing is that you only hear about bad things in the news, hurricanes, shootings, wars,.. and the people have enough of this shit.

The war affects my life due to rising energy costs and the war is also not far away (I'm german) and so I do care a lot about it. My biggest fear is that Putler starts using nukes.

11/09/2001 on the other side was something far away from me and killed ""only"" 3000 people and I don't care much. The US caused 22000 death civilians with bombings in the years after 11/09/2001 and the most US people don't care about that dead people.",xtrt7r

"People need to remember that NATO is a -military- alliance, not an arm of the UN.

Turkey is strategically key for NATO, with its geographical location with ice free ports, forward bases and access to the Mideterrainian Sea.
Like now, they block the russian black sea fleet from excerting influence in the middle east.

It also guards NATOs south eastern flank. They became a member in the 1950s I think, so restricting Soviet influence/spreading of communism was key.

Turkey in its ""liberal era"" in the 50s were radically different than today.
Economic policies, liberal values (greek liberal values like democracy etc) were profound. It haf also a largely athesit/tolerant constitution.
Turkey in the 50s were unproblematic",uswxzw
"IMHO, Turkey is not the problem, Erdogan is.",uswxzw
"Turkey : Yes.

Erdogan: No",uswxzw
"There is nothing in the NATO charter about kicking anyone out. Countries can leave,at any time with a 1 year notice.  Then they can come back if all agree to it. But nothing about kicking anyone out. It is a downside of NATO expansion. Consensus was easier when it was only 12 nations.",uswxzw
Turkey is for Thanksgiving that‚Äôs it!!!!!,uswxzw
"Erdogan is like Putin, the Kurds are his Ukraine.
Also made Turkey basically in to a dictatorship.",uswxzw
"I feel like Erdogan is a closet Putin fanboi. He is very friendly when dealing with Russia but when dealing with his actual allies, he seems to be aggressive.",uswxzw
"No problem with a free and democratic Turkey in NATO, not the case with this thinly veiled dictator Erdogan.",uswxzw
Erdogan is a problem but Turkey is a key strategic partner for NATO,uswxzw
One of these things is not like the others,uswxzw
"No, he doesn't. He has done absolutely nothing to earn the privilege, and has been working very hard over the past decade to avoid being very helpful or supportive of any NATO causes or interests. Unfortunately, NATO still needs Turkey almost solely because of its geographic position controlling the only entrance to the Black Sea, and who can pass through it. That, and its very strategic location between the Middle East and Russia, and its southwestern satellites. Kicking Turkey out of NATO would almost surely drive Erdogan, the defacto dictator of Turkey, closer into Putin's orbit and completely away from the interests of Europe and the west. Not a good thing for NATO, unfortunately. So, we're kinda stuck with the bellicose mother\*\*\*\*er, sadly. Guess we just have to keep our friends close, and our Erdogan's closer.",uswxzw
"No I have no idea how he got in with the shit his forces get up to on camera as bad if not worse than what the Russians have been caught doing but no one says shit, I think it's a case of its better to keep him close than to have him partner with someone like Russia just look at the damage his drones have been doing",uswxzw
"No, no they do not. They really do not. 

They are an autocracy in all but name, they actively suppress minorities in their own country and they flirt way too much with Russia and countries just as bad as Russia on the reg.",uswxzw
"It never belonged!
The current crisis is just another reason.",uswxzw
"Yes, given their geographical location and the history of their alliance with the west. Not to say I agree with Erdogan‚Äôs international politics, he is doing what 99% of world leaders would do in this situation. Use leverage to change or sway the opinion of countries which need them. Every political leader does this. Does not mean it is right and given the circumstances it is an awful time to do so but it happens often",uswxzw
"No, its a terrorist state! With no democratic values, no freedom of speech, housing ISIS terrorists, jailing journalists. The list can go on..",uswxzw
"Lira ~ 15.86 = 1 USD. 100 years of the Turkish Republic in 2023.
2023 = ‚Äúgeneral election‚Äù.

Will Erdogan go in 2023?",uswxzw
Yes it‚Äôs a key strategical location against Russia. This problem will be solved diplomatically. Turkey has to play nice with Europe and the Middle East. This causes them to have uneasy relations with both. However turkey and Russia have been going to war since the 15th century. Probably long before then to over control of the Black Sea. It‚Äôs a natural enemy of Russia. Since nato is basically an anti Russian defensive alliance Turkey would be reliable against them. Sometimes life forces you to choose a lesser of two evils.,uswxzw
"Yes, armchair generals.",uswxzw
No,uswxzw
"They Bosphorus  ofcourse they do. Not because they are nice, or humane or whatever, the got the entry in the Balck Sea. If you think that is not important, ask the Russian if they can bring any other vessel in to Black Sea.",uswxzw
"Every family has at least one annoying uncle. That's Turkey to NATO. Turks have a good heart, but Erdogan is a nuisance",uswxzw
Turkey belongs yes . Im sure this issue will be solved one way or another,uswxzw
"Yes, unfortunately",uswxzw
Turkey is a NATO member.,uswxzw
"They don‚Äôt belong until they prove they do, simple as that.",uswxzw
No they don't,uswxzw
"The Turks can be a little difficult.  Turkey is one of the oldest members of the NATO alliance having joined in 1952.  The Turks are going to ask for their pound of flesh before acceding to Finland and Sweden's request for NATO membership.  At this point it is just politics, I have a feeling something is going to be worked out.  Turkey position that you can't have a country being embargoed by the same countries your are in a military alliance is correct. f Turkey has been fighting the PKK for as long as I can remember so asking Turkey to go to the defense of people harboring their enemies who are actively killing Turks is a bit of a stretch.

It might be a good time to solve the Kurdish issue because never deserved the treatment that they as a people have received from the Turks.  Asking a country however to lose a fifth of its territory is asking it to commit suicide.  As an American, I would rather have the Turks with us than against us.  Finding a solution with the Kurds who helped us in that part of the world would help all of the way around.  What the solution is I don't have an answer to that.

If Turkey is thrown out of the Alliance then sooner or later a war between NATO and Turkey will take place.  I would rather not have that happen so to answer OP's question Yes, Turkey belongs in NATO.  They bring a lot to the alliance.",uswxzw
"Erdogan is the brother of Putin. Same style, same nationalistic imperial objectives.",uswxzw
"No 
Turkey should be kicked out",uswxzw
No,uswxzw
"Erdogan does not belong to NATO, but his Country Turkey does 100%. He is just another Autocrat like Putin.",uswxzw
"They absolutely do, for geopolitical reasons if for nothing else. Turkey is important strategically due to its command over the entry to the Black Sea and as a doorway to the Middle East. So all biases aside, Turkey itself is important for NATO, albeit under someone else‚Äôs guidance.",uswxzw
He's a necessary evil. Simple as that. And in part it's NATO's own fault because they never call the guys bluff and allow him that Turkish bazaar mentality where he always gets what he wants.,uswxzw
Screw them‚Ä¶they‚Äôre basically still at war with Greece‚Ä¶they were needed only long ago for US Nuclear missile deployment‚Ä¶they‚Äôre only good for hazelnuts.,uswxzw
Turkey needs a little visit from the CIA,uswxzw
We need him right now whether we believe it or not. He is keeping more of Russias fleet from coming into The Black Sea.,uswxzw
Yeah remove him from Nato so that he can join in with the Russians completely opening the Eastern gates to the Russians? Give him F16's or whatever he wants and leave him be. Nato is more important than some communist separatist guerillas.,uswxzw
"""North Atlantic"" Treaty Organisation.

A quick look at the map would suggest not. The purchase of Russian weapons and undermining of NATO makes it a no brainer. Get them out.",uswxzw
No,uswxzw
He is the reason for me and family not spending our vacation in Turkey. If a more liberal man/woman is heading this beautiful country: count me in ‚ò∫Ô∏èüëç,uswxzw
It does. The spat over Finland and Sweden can be solved.,uswxzw
I don‚Äôt like the view Erdogan has on the Kurds at all. But other that he‚Äôs a shithead that belongs in NATO. Yes he is a arrogant shithead just like Puter.,uswxzw
Can someone be kicked out of NATO,uswxzw
"Is this the time to ask that ""a house devided"" and all that",uswxzw
Does Turkey have veto power in NATO?,uswxzw
No,uswxzw
Turkey does. Erdogan doesn‚Äôt.,uswxzw
Erdogan is a wave of crazy NATO needs to ride out. Turkey is vital to the hegemony of the West. It doesn't matter how hostile things get. The long term picture is more important. Things will go back to normal when he leaves power. He is 70. 10-15 more years is nothing in the grand scheme of things.,uswxzw

"Gonna put on my armchair general hat.

They realized they can't take Kyiv without a bloodbath they cannot afford or using weapons of mass destruction. So they are regrouping their forces, most likely will try to consolidate the gains in the east and south, while leaving some pawns behind to keep the capital on its toes.

If I were Ukraine I would push as hard as possible with any forces that can be used to drive away the Russians in Donbass and Kherson before they can be reinforced. Time is essential.",tral7m
"Yes obviously a troop pull back would be a first step to using chemical weapons. 

Russians have pulled back from Kyiv, mykolaiv, and also Harkiv area (I think?)

But, at this time, I don‚Äôt think Russian would gain anything tactically from using chemical weapons on those areas. 

More troubling I think would be a pull back from say Sumy/Izium/Rubhizen/  or Mariupol- but I don‚Äôt think Russia has pulled away from those cities.",tral7m
"Its possible thats what they're doing. I think i read a US report somewhere that said if Russias first wave failed, their doctrine was to pull back, regroup, and reassess the situation. They could try another push or they could count their losses and go home. Up to the Russians really.",tral7m
"The Russian soldiers don‚Äôt have enough material as is, how reliable are their stores of ABC-protection gear or how far do you trust the seals on a Russian tank?

Also, NATO will hurt Putin.",tral7m
"Dude, they're retreating because they're about to get cut off and surrounded. That's it. Let's see if they can manage an organized retreat or if this becomes a rout.",tral7m
"Redeployment is common.

Kyiv is the center of attention globally and for UA forces. It is holding. This is drawing vast resources in men and materials away from the south and the East.

This is good for Russia.

Russia has secured a land corridor from Crimea across Donbass and Luhansk. It cut off a significant amount of UA forces doing this and has a great foothold in the areas they expected to receive the most support.

The reality might not match expectation, however this is a good strategic place. The world certainly didn't see this taking a month either.

I expect you're likely to see consolidation in areas N of Kyiv and a measured advance West from the occupied areas. Possibly with a directed push across Odessa to link up with Russian forces in Moldova.

It is not a wholesale withdrawal preempting nuclear bombardment or anything else. At worst it might be a bait for the UA forces to overextend themselves rushing to reclaim the airstrips and show the world they are advancing",tral7m

And that‚Äôs the part that scares me. We THE PEOPLE ARE ALWAYS A CASUALTY,t7vvg2
"You all seem to forget that it is possible to feel empathy for both the Ukrainian victims of this senseless war as well as for the Russian victims of these sanctions who have absolutely nothing to do with Putin‚Äôs foreign policy.

Humanism is a two-sided coin guys. Stop looking at the world through a black and white lens.",t7vvg2
"as with the iraq war , our leaders gave us a public message of wmd and confussed it with 911 but where secretly working on area denial of the chinese and the stopping of iraq/iran becoming a powerful duo .",t7vvg2
Be great to hear an alternative. Putin is responsible for this. The only alternative I've heard from the West is Nato military action which would put the fall of the rouble and IKEA closing down in Russia right into perspective..,t7vvg2
"we should also not ignore that we dont tolerate nazis or nazi parties in europe , regardless of their numbers",t7vvg2
"People in Ukraine are dying. When Muscovites are in danger of starvation due to sanctions, then I'll reconsider. Until then, no one should care.",t7vvg2
"its simple , if the west does something = good , east does something = bad , previously it was the middle east but more selective.  people brought up in comfort with action movies and video games think war with russia is a good thing , because they are bad and we have better armies. The reality is this has nothing to do with people or ukraine and everything to do with furthering full spectrum dominance . the poor people of ukraine are pawns and the poor people of russia dont realise without security russia would be destroyed anyway.",t7vvg2
"Russians are still supporting putin because they are passionate about defeating nazis - fact is that azov battalion is full of nazis, even facebook had them banned for this , something you can easily google yourself - putin has used this as perfect propaganda, as the russians have a passionate dislike in their core values against anything nazi , hence they will happily suffer under this narrative , depite the nazis only gettting 3% vote that is still proof they exist . hence why i said let those azov families move west and then his main reasons are destroyed and he will lose his public support or claim his mission achieved.",t7vvg2
"you do realise russia and ukraine contribute massively to the world food stocks and that its more likely people outside this conflict will starve as a result of the sanctions , not russians?",t7vvg2
"No. Nobody cares about Russians missing a paycheck, worrying about rent, or having to cancel their vacations to Ibiza.",t7vvg2
"There is a big difference here.  
Russian SOLDIERS are dying.  Soldiers have are killing innocent civilians, soldiers that are inside a foreign country, soldiers that are invading, soldiers that are waging an unprovoked war.  

And don‚Äôt come back with the whole ‚Äòunder the command of‚Äô garbage.  Who‚Äôs at fault the person that pulls the trigger or the one who told him to pull the trigger?  BOTH!",t7vvg2
"It's not that hard to understand. Citizens of a country always end up feeling the effects of the decisions their leaders make, good or bad, whether they chose the leader or not. Is it fair? No, but life isn't fair, either. Yes, I empathize with the average Russian, but as long as Putin continues invading his neighbors, his citizens will suffer the consequences.",t7vvg2
You‚Äôre absolutely right. Just damn,t7vvg2
"this is encouraged as much by the west as it is started by the russians, sometimes the quickest path to peace is letting the larger army win.   
Libya is a prime example - 30 ppl died and that started a bombing and arming campaign by nato that not only destroyed the country but killed 1000's of ppl . if gaddafi did his thing it would have ended with the 30 ppl and so others maybe going to jail   


syria - civil protest would have been repressed within day with very little loss of life , in comes nato g's up the rebels and syria is destroyed with huge loss of life and migrants flowing  


If ukraine moved out its azov battalion to europe , layed down arms and then carried out civil protest, they would have more chance of winning as putin would run out of money feeding them and most would live and the country would not get destroyed , and here again we see nato telling them to fight to death but not with nato troops . same old same old .",t7vvg2
"Yes, it's brutal. No, we shouldn't stop the sanctions (until the war ends).",t7vvg2
"and i totaly agree , the narative is for the russian public , as i said perfect propaganda",t7vvg2
"the goverment narrative is purely security , crimea is important hence the bold moves in 2015 to secure it , lack of land access and the ukraine blocking its fresh water is a thorn putin hoped the donbas region would resolve through minsk but the west keeps refusing to recognise crimea despite knowing the people who live there support it becoming russian. he has also complained about nato missile systems that are dual use not just defensive and refuses to accept anymore ie ukraine becoming nato , it is a threat that no one argues the usa or uk would be acting exactly the same way if an agressive aliance was setting up on their borders",t7vvg2
"in historical context , israel annexed the golan hieghts to secure water access after syria blocked the fresh water there. putin probably believes he has the same rights, but doesnt want to upset assad by making comparision",t7vvg2
"putting down arms is not rolling over , its preventing death and finding a way to live and protest, the only bullshit is you claiming they would be getting bombed if there were no armies resisting.",t7vvg2
"40m ppl refusing to work and protesting peacefully in the modern connected world would result in a lot less death than taking arms , hiding armies among the public and chest thumping , war wont work once people realise this . ghandi showed  there are still victims in the pacifist way but it previals.  im anti war and anti division , put the average russian , iraqi , chinese , african , brazilian in a room with a tv and football and maybe you will realise poor people just dont care for war or their goverments or military alliances",t7vvg2
I don‚Äôt care about Russians starving or eating until they pull out of Ukraine - let them eat grass and potato until then - they can use their house for wood for fire,t7vvg2
"did the average person care about each and every one of the 1m killed in iraq or the birth defects from du - we care when the news tells us too .  
everyday i ask the same question , if china , russia and iran formed EATO and then got a deal to run excercises and rotate equipment out of a hyperthetical friendly mexico or canada or independant scotland - can you honestly say the west would not do exactly what putin is doing . during the cuban missle crisis the world was almost destroyed over a much lesser incident.",t7vvg2

"Ah, so the US gave Saddam the 'green light' to invade Kuwait in 1990? LOL! You been drinking some weird kool-aid. And if the US was somehow 'encouraging' Putin to invade Ukraine by loudly warning the world of Putin's intentions and military buildup to invade Ukraine for the last couple of months, and loudly warning him NOT to invade, well, that's a pretty weird way of encouraging him. The only country that thought it would benefit from starting this war, was Putin/Russia. And he was entirely mistaken. Nobody else wanted him to invade, that's for sure.

As for the pile of dead vehicles and russian soldiers, don't underestimate the Ukrainian army, militia, and their will to resist. There are a lot of western anti-tank missiles and anti-air missiles on their shoulders, but no western 'special forces' units firing them.

If he bailed and No western nations came to help do you think that the Ukraine armed forces would be still fighting? I bet whoever was left would say "" fuck this in not dying for leaders who turn tail and run"" I really think if the president did not stick it out Russia would have been much more successful so far.  Plus look at what happened in Crimea and Donbas, they rolled over for Russia there so I'm sure Putin thought he could swoop in, either assassinate the president or the president would flee and take Kyiv quickly, The Ukrainians wouldn't resist much, and install his puppet government and it would be over and they would be mopping up small pockets of resistance.

Both sides will downplay their own casualties. Countries be like that in wartime.,u4ka03
I think it gets confusing defining Ukrainian forces.  My understanding is lots of militia/armed citizens have been killed and may not be counted as killed 'soldiers'.,u4ka03
Probably double that. But still its 3:1 K/D ratio,u4ka03
"Yeah definitely but I‚Äôve realized being Pro-Ukrainian that I honestly don‚Äôt care about our KIA numbers. I don‚Äôt go hunting for their daily numbers, I want to see how many new dead Russians there are. I know our losses are not higher than the Russians 20,000 KIA and that‚Äôs all that matters to me.",u4ka03
"I think is possible, in the controlled areas. They can count in their territory, where they can see the bodies. And in this moment they don't need to estimate the ""lost ones"". For real numbers, we need the end of the war. But I trust the ukranian numbers. It's their territory. And they want to be right in front of the world. Nobody believed they sunked the Moskva, but at the end it was the truth. They need to be right and honest as much as possible, and keep their credibility high. Zelensky, in the first days of war said ""nobody believed us when we said.... And now...""  That's it, in my opinion. The war between the lies and the truth. The war between the darkness and the light. This is how Ukraine is fighting. Of course this is my opinion, but you can see how they turned the world on their side. And this happens only with the facts. And it's a ""little country ""...",u4ka03
Still a good ratio,u4ka03
"Yeah, the numbers are too low because they aren‚Äôt revealing the information. We will just have to speculate for now until they release new info.",u4ka03
Good thing we got you out there counting,u4ka03
"I don‚Äôt understand why you‚Äôre confused. That latest US estimate is only through March 9, while the Ukrainian estimate is through April 16. That‚Äôs an additional 5 weeks of heavy combat‚Ä¶ of course there will be differences.",u4ka03
"They probably are too low.

&#x200B;

However, a 2:1 or even a 3:1 kill to death ratio is somewhat normal. I think the U.S has an average 8:1 kill death ratio. I heard someone say that if you are going to take a country, you need to match the army's strength 10 times  . Not sure true this is though.

&#x200B;

I really don't care too much for the numbers, and Russia clearly doesn't care either. I just want the war to end, and this is just a means for this.",u4ka03
Yes its called propaganda now shut up and acknowledge (this is a joke for people with a broader understanding),u4ka03

cause he will instantly take it as a declaration of war,t85jew
"Some of the humanitarian corridors set up during the cease-fire to evacuate women, children and the elderly failed in some places. Words mean nothing if the other party refuses to hear. 

Enforcing a no fly zone would mean actually enforcing- possibly engaging in combat. NATO won‚Äôt risk it at this stage.",t85jew
"Cause it would mean WW3, but honestly, I don't see how we avoid that at this point since Russia is literally being cancelled by the world.",t85jew
"As i understand it:

Enforcing no-fly zone is not just sending sorties, first you have to disable opponent sir defenses and cripple their ability to muster their own planes. Otherwise it will be your planes that get blown out of the sky.

Which probably means striking targets in Belarus and Russia. Giving Putin what he misses now at most - means to muster internal support and boost morale of their army.",t85jew
"A no fly zone literally means they will shoot down what ever is in the sky. That means moving anti air around targeted cities or the country as a whole. Seeing how this is a war to stop NATO expansion, NATO expanding into the country or around the country will directly contradict what Putin is trying to accomplish. 

Putin has also made it very clear that if the West looks at them in the wrong way it's a declaration of war. Every time the West has stated doing the smallest thing for Ukraine, it's a War declaration in his eyes.

Third point is, a truce was made for a 7 hour safety corridor to be made for fleeing civilians. Half an hour in, Russians began shelling said corridor and the area they were fleeing. It is not above the Russians at this point, even if they allow a no fly zone, to send in a scarificial lamb, get it shot down and start crying that the West did something wrong, so now it's WW3. Which is what NATO is trying to prevent by staying an arm's reach away from the conflict.",t85jew
Because someone needs to enforce the no fly zone. Means NATO has to shoot the planes down that violate it.,t85jew
"Because then we would have to kill Putin. He‚Äôs not going to stop flying. If we say don‚Äôt fly and he flies then we kill. If we kill he attacks. If he attacks Moscow will not exist anymore, and maybe France and England as well.

The problem is that he will fly and we will destroy anything and everything. He knows it so he‚Äôll try to send his off first.",t85jew
"i think about it like when i was a kid, and my mom or dad would ground me.  my parents were divorced and did not communicate with each other.  so, if one of my parents grounded me, i thought ""you go to work, guess i am not grounded anymore"".  in other words, if you cannot enforce it, its meaningless.  can't just say to russia ""this is a no fly zone"" and have no mechanism to enforce it.",t85jew
"And why would Putin abide?
Especially if NATO tells them they won‚Äôt fight the Russians directly.
The reality is NATO can‚Äôt and won‚Äôt do a damn thing besides supply arms, vehicles and food to Ukraine, and sanction Russia. Anything beyond that starts the next world war.",t85jew

"Idk what that post was, but Russia is very much not winning. They've paid out death benefits for 48,000 soldiers. Depleted their ammo and equipment to the point they're planning to go after 50 yr old Soviet munitions in Moldova. Their economy is fucked, because there's no quick reset button that will reverse the damage their banks did to it. They've been forced to go from taking all of Ukraine, to hoping they can hold the land they stole in 2014, with the entire West no longer recognizing any claims they think they have. They are threatening nukes, something they won't actually do, but it's a tactic used to project a strength they don't have. China and India aren't really supporting Russia and have said as much. Putin is forced to beg NK for ammo, he's pulled all his remaining AA from Syria to use in Ukraine, and it's been worthless. He's running out of Wagner group. Belarus is refusing to fight for Russia. Chechnya isn't in a position to offer anything but TikTok videos. 

There's just no win left to them. 

On the battlefield, Ukrainians are still dying. They've started their first, of what will need to be several offensives. They're still outnumbered and outgunned, but their morale is high. They have the direct support of 49 countries, supplying weapons and aid. They're about to reach areas that have been entrenched for 8 years. They've been invaded. They've already lost too much, but every day are stronger and more determined. They've got the future financial backing of the US, NATO, and EU. They've got contacts and support from across Africa. The southern former Soviet states, are not only supporting Ukraine, but discussing attacking Russia and returning their lands Putin stole. 

There's just no way Ukraine will lose.",xaywkl
"Take a few moments to peruse the Hot posts on a couple of the Ukraine related subs. Perhaps examine a few maps on Twitter.

Long answer: Russia is cut off from supply to the North through Kupiansk and Izyum by a recent lightning offensive that captured their critical rail-hubs. A large portion of their best troops are trapped on the wrong side of a river whose crossings are controlled by Ukrainian artillery.

Short Answer: Russia is fucked",xaywkl
Right now Ukraina is winning,xaywkl
"Russia is doing a lot of things. Winning isnt one of them. Russian troops have low morale, are poorly trained,  have terrible equipment( compared to what NATO countries field and have been giving to Ukraine), and the UAF keeps blowing up their ammo depots...or capturing them.

They are so desperate that they are buying drones from Iran, which seem to have some quality control issues, and ammo from North Korea. The Ukrainian counter offensive has liberated over 1500 sq km in the last two weeks and the Russians are routing on the Northern front and trapped with their backs to the river and no crossing on the southern front.

I would say a ""fail cascade"" would describe the Russian momentum right now. Wherever you are getting your info, i would stop because they are absolute garbage.",xaywkl
Russia is incredibly more capable of retreats than when they started the war. Practice makes perfect I guess,xaywkl
"1st: there's nothing wrong with Vice as a source. 2nd: that video was based on what had happened in Ukraine before the offensive. of course everything has changed dramaticallysince then. Russia will be pushed out of Ukraine completely. it is just a matter of time.

Russia is gaining momentum in their advance East,xaywkl
"It will take time for Russia to replace its trained fighters even if they mobilize for war. Ukraine has an opportunity right now to hold the separatist regions at persistent threat while freeing itself of other fronts. 

Russia moved what was left of its professional military to Kherson for a fight that didn‚Äôt come, and Ukraine is mowing through their rear-echelon at a fast pace. 

I don‚Äôt think this offensive will amount to Ukraine taking back all of the DPR/LPR, but it‚Äôs going to severely damage Russia‚Äôs already strained logistical situation just months before the winter sets in. Oh‚Ä¶ and Ukraine is getting winter supplies from the US, Canada, the UK, and the Nordics. They‚Äôll be more able to fight in the winter than the Russians.",xaywkl
"No one is winning.  
Every one is losing.  
Some just lose less than others.",xaywkl

Why don't you post a link to the video? If Vice was interviewing Russian reporters then consider the source.,xaywkl
i would appreciate a link if you have one.,xaywkl
"Much more capable? They took most of their land gains very early in the war, and have not really moved the frontlines in 5 months. The north east is also in a full collapse. I wouldn‚Äôt be surprised if by Monday all Donbas was taken back.",xaywkl
"> Russia is much more capable now than it was earlier in the war

Yeah.. But that's not saying much, is it? Considering how insanely incompetent they were it would be hard to imagine them becoming even less competent. Considering how many got slaughtered, there almost has to be some kind of natural selection process going on in their ranks.",xaywkl
"Russians are not winning in that they're advancing, they're playing defense. Chance of an all-out Russian victory are zero in that they beat the Ukraine forces and take over the capital city. 

Ukraine is winning heavily on the Kharkiv front. Minor gains on the Kherson front. No major gains on any other front. Crimea is a very tough nut to crack as they effectively have a ""moat"" and a ""bridge"". 

It depends what the end-game is. Could be a North-South Korea situation.",xaywkl
"For now, Ukraine is having the upper hand ; keep in mind that it's far from a snowball and things can change",xaywkl
"This was in May:

[Russia has likely suffered devastating losses amongst its mid and junior ranking officers in the conflict. Brigade and battalion commanders likely deploy forwards into harm‚Äôs way because they are held to an uncompromising level of responsibility for their units‚Äô performance](https://twitter.com/DefenceHQ/status/1531143716840284161)",xaywkl
Don't watch orc media. ![gif](emote|free_emotes_pack|rage),xaywkl
"The US couldn't subdue Iraq and Afghanistan. Russia failed beating the Ukrainian army, something the US could do in Iraq and Afghanistan. The US is much better armed with more modern weapons than Russia. Unlike Afghanistan and Iraq, Ukraine actually has the support of the West and all their weapons. 

On top of that the Ukrainian people are better educated compared to Iraq and Afghanistan. Average soldiers decide the tactics used in combat, unlike in Iraq and Afghanistan where the top decided everything. And despite the relatively recent revolution in Ukrain, it is a much stabler state than Iraq and Afghanistan.

So the attacker is weaker and the defender stronger than the US wars with Iraq and Afghanistan. Russia never had a change.",xaywkl
"Noone bc it's a f\*king war. 

But in the best case UA gets their land back with minimum casualties and putin gets fucked by his own men.",xaywkl
"I watched the video. I would not describe it like you did at all. There's no quote specifically saying that Russia is ""much more capable."" They're just saying Russia is fighting a long, grinding war of attrition. And the reporters do admit that they have to ""check their priors"" since the Kharkiv counteroffensive has begun.",xaywkl
" ""very popular media outlet"" sounds similar to ""everybody tells me""

Wish they would have posted a link to it.",xaywkl

What the f is he going to do? He literally can not fire a nuke without killing every one of his people. Once a nuke is in the air, it is game over for humans. If he is willing to end life on this planet over this, then we would forever be held hostage to his authoritarian Trump-like whims. I say call his bluff!

"The first thing you can do is use a space after each period ending your sentences. The wall of text will push people away from even bothering to read your message, and your message is good and urgent. Also, break up your message into blocks; 3 to 4 sentences each block. 

Second, rioting against Putin isn't going to happen. The ""spreading the word"" is about as spread as it's going to be. It's all over every news channel of every station of ever country in the world. People are watching. 

But, that's mostly all anyone can do is watch and here's why:

Ukraine isn't part of NATO, and NATO is directly opposed to Russia and is the major threat to Russian power. NATO is the powder keg that explodes and starts World War 3 if it does anything against Russia. And World War 3 will likely escalate to some usage of nuclear weapons, by most sides involved. It would be devastating to the world, versus what is happening now is just devastating to Ukraine.

Imagine you have to watch your neighbors house burn down and your neighbors along with them. And if you try to help, the entire neighborhood burns down, including you and your family. What would you do? It's a bad spot to be in, but the lesser evil is to watch the victims.

The compromise is support for Ukraine, indirectly; ammunition, supplies, and choking Russia through non-military means; economically, and others. That's what so many nations have been doing, and it has caused a lot of pain for the Russian people. The leadership has to buckle eventually.

It remains possible that Putin and the Russian leaders escalate and push more powerfully and more violently to reach their goals, it can get really, really bad, but it also remains possible that Ukraine will hold out long enough that Russia has to call it quits. At least for now.

But Russia is screwed again for a long time, at least until Putin and anyone like him is gone from Russian influence and the Russian people can join the democratic table with the rest of the world, but it's likely Russia and Iran and China will remain in close arms until Armageddon.

Russia will never be powerful enough to rule the Earth - World War 3 will devastate the nations of the planet enough that there won't be a world to rule, so fear of Russia conquering everyone isn't rational. It would be a real concern if China and Iran and Russia pushed everything they had all at the same time, but Russia is doing this pretty much alone and is struggling to reach any of the initial goals.

Ultimately, it remains a wait-and-see event for the majority of the world. If Russia ingresses a NATO country, then NATO responds and things go kaboom. So Russia will be careful to only attack non-NATO countries like Ukraine, and the non-NATO's will have to remain vigilant and support the victims as much as possible without sparking an international conflict.

Also, thank you for the heart of your message; I hope everyone remains with the sense of urgency to help Ukraine. In the desire to help, I believe avenues will be found that are acceptable.",t6nd8s

"I think if putin did use even 1 tactical nuke in Ukraine it would send the whole of the Russian population into panic fearing a massive retaliation by the west and it would give the west the green light to give Ukraine what ever weapons it needed including long range missiles. 

Putin is mad but not completely stupid. All he wants right now is to hold on to power and stay alive. So I don‚Äôt think he will use nukes in Ukraine.",xtioqg
"It would be an appalling act, but I doubt it will ever happen.  Putin is much better off garrisoning the South and leaving the liberated Luhansk and Donetsk as an excuse to come back next year for a second go, hoping that a harsh winter will have debilitated the West and Ukraine‚Äôs will and ability to fight.

The risks and fallout (pardon the pun) are just too high. More cynically, when did Putin ever do what he promised or not do what he denied he would?",xtioqg
"I think...or hope...that even if Putin is crazy enough to order it, somewhere down the line the responsible ones realize what it would mean and that there is no going back from it anymore. 
Putin maybe hasn't much to lose as old almost dead Dictator, but they have. They have families, relatives, friends...and not everyone is as a psycho as Putin is.",xtioqg
"I don't think they'll do it, there's not a 0% chance of it happening, but I think they know that it would be suicide for them to try.",xtioqg
"Best way for russia to be wiped out.


But at least the world will be free of ruskie trolls.",xtioqg
It would be the end of Russia.,xtioqg
"I'm feeling less positive, especially if he starts really believing his own deluded rhetoric and lies. Have you read his last speech? Weird little c\*nt. The risk is very high imho, which f\*cks me off no end as I am living close to potential target areas. However, he cannot be allowed to keep escalating, which he has done in the past. Our survival may well come down to how poorly maintained and corruptly sabotaged his arsenal is and how good we are at shooting what's left out of the sky.",xtioqg
"I think it could happen. If it does, there would be some massive retaliation on the Russian leadership and military on Russian soil. There would be a dangerous escalation, but not reacting to a tactical nuke is too dangerous a precedent to set given the nations capable of using them.",xtioqg
"So the local bully is robbing and beating up your neighbour, and every time you say stop, they threaten to beat you up also!   
What do you do?    
\-Nothing?  It just means they'll keep doing what they are doing and come for you sometime in the future once they are ready!  
\-Fight Back? They may be forced to come for you when they aren't ready, probably not at all!",xtioqg
"I think that first off, the powers that are still aiding and trading with Russia- like India and China would be pretty much forced to abandon them.  Global pressure would be ramped up to an enormous level.

Biden has promised severe consequences.  I think that would mean at the very least giving Ukraine heavy weapons and armaments in large numbers including ATCAMS, M1 Abrams tanks, fighter jets, etc.

It might even include a US/Nato attack on Russian installations- something proportional like wiping out the base the nuclear attack was started from.  Doing that inside of Russia might be too risky though.  Possibly something like destroying their fleet in the Black Sea.  

If if it was just 1 or 2 tactical nukes- the US would not use nukes, but would 

1.  amp up the pressure to totally isolate Russia;
2. deliver every weapon they could to Ukraine;
3. some sort of proportional attack on Russian forces.

If China and India still tried to play the neutral game after a Russian nuke attack- then things could get very hairy.  If they agreed to isolate Russia after it, then the vice would tighten and Russia would fall.",xtioqg
"plus- the US could institute a no-fly-zone in Ukraine.

the last thing the Russians want is a NATO base in Russia with F-35's, F-15's, and nuclear capable bombers being in their back yard.",xtioqg
"Retaliation should be done to Putin's regime and Duma and their families and children. 

They should know that their family tree is erased if they go to that path.

I don't think that military threats are enough, they are already sacrifising military, one black sea fleet is nothing.

People don't seem to understand that we are against evil here, normal methods don't work.

Putin probably doesn't care about anything, but his puppets and henchmens are maybe not pure evil like him. Threat to target their families.",xtioqg
"I don't think NATO would sit by idle (or only respond with economic and political measures), like Russian propagandists say, but I also don't share the optimism of it militarily pushing Russia back to its internationally recognized borders, as many in Ukraine hope, as that would carry too high of a risk of escalating to full blown WW3.

I think what will happen is that NATO forces will declare themselves peacekeepers to prevent a nuclear apocalypse, and enter under the pretence of not a belligerent on the side of Ukraine, but on a neutral party to force a ceasefire. They might declare a ""no nuke zone"" similar to a ""no fly zone"" (which will likely be included in the former), and all Russian vehicles within Ukraine capable of delivering nukes (aircraft, long range missiles, long range artillery) will be targeted. To remain neutral and not give Ukraine a one-sided advantage (which Russia would interpret as directly joining the war on the side of Ukraine), NATO would be forced to adopt the same stance towards Ukrainian assets. Therefore, neither side would operate missiles, aircraft, or artillery across the declared no-nuke zone, which would grind offensive operations to a halt. For all other targets, NATO forces would have the stance of ""not fire unless fired upon"".

The effect of this would be not a return to the February 24 borders, but a creation of a status quo DMZ, similar to the Korean DMZ. I think this is the most NATO can do without escalating the conflict to an unacceptably high global nuclear war risk. It is also a reason why Russia is not (yet) interested in using nukes - it believes it can still make progress with general mobilization, and doesn't want a NATO-enforced end of the conflict without Ukraine formally conceding the territories Russia annexed but Ukraine still occupies. Ukraine, on the other hand, still sees a chance to recapture more territory, so will not agree to a NATO-enforced ceasefire and DMZ unless Russia uses nukes.

Of course, Russia could choose to attack the NATO forces themselves (which would lead to WW3), but the important difference is that the ball would be in Russia's court to do so, and they could still have an off-ramp to accept the NATO-enforced ceasefire and keep (at least de-facto if not de-jure) whatever territory they occupy at the time, rather than the scenario where their only options are either a full retreat or WW3.",xtioqg
"If they use Nuke, it will start WWII. it will conclude with world as we know and  the end off Russia.",xtioqg
"Russians might be crazy enough to go nuclear. But it would be a terrible idea all around. 

1. It will not stop ukraine, nor stop support by its supporters. 
2. Russia fails because the cleptocracy has instituted a culture of lying while the top flogs stuff and saves on service. This cannot be compensated for with untrained new recruits, nor with nuclear weapons. 
3. I'm sure several responses by Ukraine's supporters have been considered and the consequences would be terribel.",xtioqg
I was adamant that Putin wouldn't invade Ukraine. I wouldn't put anything past him now that he is losing,xtioqg
Is there not a single Russian willing and capable of assassinating Putin BEFORE he presses those buttons.,xtioqg
"I would think the black sea fleet would be future corral, every russian sub out in open water would sink from a rogue smoker and all ruussian forces on the ground in Ukraine and crimea would go the way of the dodo within 48 hours..",xtioqg
"My thought is that if Russia uses a tactical nuke, the west should sink the entire Russian navy. We can do it using conventional weapons. It would really send a message.",xtioqg

"The Russians have done an interesting job playing out some version of a large variety of military disasters.  

They stalled outside of Kyiv just like the Germans stalled outside of Moscow in '41.  

They got airmobile units overextended and crushed just as the Allies did during Market Garden, '44.  

They seem to have expended a large proportion of their remaining armored forces in an operation that is a virtual mirror image of Kursk, '43.  

Now they've lost most of their offensive capability and can only advance behind massed artillery, like all sides in the First World War in, say, 1916.  

They've lost high level commanders at a rate pretty comparable to the Confederates in the American Civil War.  

And it looks to me like they're prepared to keep devolving all the way down to the plague-spreading marauders of the Thirty Years War.",vp060c

"Nope. Dont worry about it. Its mutually assured destruction, even Putin isnt that crazy.

Remember Russia would have to target most key cities in every major country in the world and they just dont have enough nukes for that, especially bearing in mind they haven‚Äôt even been maintaining their rifles, never mind the nukes (remember they also have an expiry date too). But in return, every other country would only have to target Russia. If Russia dared fire a nuke it would mean the extinction of the Russians and they know it.

Dont worry about their threats to use nukes, they are projecting. They have to use the nuclear threat because there is no other threat they can use. Believe me, if Russia really had an advantage over Ukraine or the West they would definitely have used it by now.",xdk9zr
"I don‚Äòt know you and how your psych works.
(this is not meant mean in any way)
Also, I am not a shrink. Just a friendly redditor trying to help you to cope with the situation.

Maybe, this can help you, to cope with your fears.

We all are constantly surrounded by potential fatal dangers.
Most of the time, we are just not aware.

That particular threat (nuclear strike) is now just among the potential threats we constantly hear, read and maybe even talk about.
That looks like it is more imminent then other threats.
It‚Äòs not. We just don‚Äòt read every other day about how dangerous traffic is, or homework for example. Therefore, we do not bother about those threats.

One way to cope with your anxiety is therefore quit consuming news about it. Stop reading into the subject. Focus on more uplifting topics.

Rational approach: We are constantly threatened with nuclear overkill.
It seems like it‚Äòs more imminent than perhaps before 2021.
But then also, before 2020 no one was bothered with the threat of a global pandemic. 

There are threats out there you can‚Äòt avoid.
At least, you can‚Äòt avoid a nuclear strike without really dedicated preparations. But, those preparations would affect your life in a way that completely would change your approach to life.
Build a shelter, move out of an area of potential first strike targets.
Prepare for the aftermath and so on.

But, is it really that imminent?
We do not know (with our brains) we just feel a certain way about it.
That feeling, that emotion can be transformed.
For example if you avoid to constantly think about it.
Or, to rationalise your emotional illogic fears.

üôÇ
I‚Äòm no native english speaker. I hope I was understood.

Big nuclear weapons are meant to deter, not to be used.
Small nuclear weapons will more likely (but still unlikely) be used in Ukraine, than outside.

However, keep in mind: Russian wants land, workforce and minerals and stuff.
Nobody can make use of a nuclear wasteland.
Stay positive.",xdk9zr
">Never thought one crazy dictator is all it takes to end life on Earth forever.

There's a huge command chain between him and the guy who turns the key. Putin is kind of hated right now, even in Russia, so if he decides to do it, it will end with him getting some air time. And the war will likely be over.",xdk9zr
"What? This has no chance of happening, and is far lower than the Cold War. Russia and NATO went back and forth about the rules of the conflict, and both agreed that nuclear weapons won't be used and the war will be contained to Ukraine. We have made some significant improvements since 1914 where we can keep conflicts smaller and more contained. If the world was operating by 1914 logic, China and Taiwan would be at war, North Korea would be attacking the South, and everyone would have declared war on each other. We learned the hard way that it's not worth it.

Have you seen tactical nuclear weapons being used yet? It's part of official Russian army doctrine, yet we haven't. They can't even use those because they would risk greater reprisals. NATO already said even a limited strike against Ukraine would be a strike against NATO. Russia knows what that means. 

Russia is the least worrisome country as well because of the corruption. I wouldn't trust half their warheads to even work or launch.",xdk9zr
Nope out of my control if shit hits the fan I'm just going to sit back and enjoy the massive firework,xdk9zr
"Every morning I wake up and look out the window to see if the world has been incinerated overnight with my house somehow escaping unscathed. Then I look in on the kids before checking the news in hope that Putin didn't wake up.

I think Putin's ego might make him want to take the world out with him when he goes but he would be stopped before he could enter the codes. Any highly placed Russian with ambition can surely see that their biggest get out now is to get rid of Vlad, claim it was solely his doing, and get back to selling fossil fuels as soon as regime change has been implemented. There are still vast personal fortunes to be made and yachts to be bought if they play their cards right.",xdk9zr
All my grandfather said was ‚Äúwelcome to the Cold War‚Äù.,xdk9zr
"No nukes are going to be detonated in this special operation by the Russians, even so called ""tactical nukes"". If one was used by the Russians don't you think NATO would immediately launch a reprisal by nuking Moscow? Or some other major Russian city? Or some major internal infrastructure?  Mr Putin knows this very well and so does his top military advisors. Mr Putin also has to deal with his military leaders who would be charged with pressing the red button to launch the attack, would any actually do it?",xdk9zr
"I'm not going to lie, at the beginning of the war I was afraid as well. What killed the fear for me was to understand that Putin and his clique were KGB officers before they took over government. If this man has learned one thing in his life, then it is how to intimidate and spread fear. That's what he was trained on. I understood that the fear I felt was exactly what Putin intended.

The first step to stand up against bullies is to be not afraid. In fact each threat and initimadation atempt that comes out of the kremlin now just strengthens my determination.",xdk9zr
Not at all bro.  Get a grip. üòÇüòÇüòÇ,xdk9zr
Naw. Gonna die one day and if it's with that many others should end quite a bit of suffering.,xdk9zr
"As a GenXer I grew up thinking that nuclear war was an inevitability. Not so much an 'if', but a 'when'.",xdk9zr
No I am not afraid to die when it comes it comes life is short if you worry about it you can not life you're short life that's why I am not scared it's not In my power it's out of my hands so try to set you're mind on the fun things in life,xdk9zr
"Nope, even though Putin maybe crazy he's not suicidal.  We were at greater risk for nuclear war in the past than the present",xdk9zr
Nope. Hundreds of nukes have been exploded here already and we are all fine.,xdk9zr
Can't let that hang over you bud. I remember a woman that was so afraid during the Cold War that she decided not to have children and then had massive regrets years later. Life goes on so stay positive.,xdk9zr
I‚Äôve had a good run if that we‚Äôre to happen but I don‚Äôt think it will,xdk9zr
"Not really. Grew up in the tail end of the cold war, and remember the fear from back then, and I think it's highly unlikely anyone is crazy enough to start a nuclear war even Putler and his cronies. Because at the end of the day they want themselves and their family to survive too. But if it happens... Well we're all going to die some day anyway. Nothing good comes out of worrying. Just live your life to the best of your ability.",xdk9zr
The Russian nuclear threat has been my concern from the onset. At first I thought as long as Russian territory isn‚Äôt threatened the nukes wouldn‚Äôt be used but now with an embarrassing defeat that crazy bastard putass could do anything.,xdk9zr
I remind myself that the Russians love their children too,xdk9zr
"I think about it often, but if it happens it happens, just enjoy the ‚Äúnow‚Äù.. worrying is a waste of time it just prevents you from enjoying your life right now.",xdk9zr
LoL ü§£ü§£ü§£ü§£ü§£,xdk9zr
"I choose to believe it‚Äôs 100% out my control. It will happen if it does, or it just won‚Äôt. I can‚Äôt be bothered to put mental effort into being afraid of an event that only a handful of people can control.",xdk9zr
"Not constant.  Because, there are worse things than nuclear war. And, they are inevitable.  Nuke war is just 'highly probable' in a adversarial geopolitical system that we have.",xdk9zr
"No, don't do that to yourself.  It's a near practical impossibility and even if it was possible, nothing you're going to do about it.",xdk9zr
"No because: 

1. Russian military equipment isn't in good shape. It is unlikely Russia has more than a couple of dozen functional nukes on any platform. Some will say The US and Russia inspect each other's stockpile but we could say we knew Russia has 12,000 tanks to when the reality was only about 2000 of them actual work. 
2. Getting people to follow those orders to launch or not to sabotage a launch will be difficult for the current government. 
3. The West has defenses and defense strategies for that scenario and every other scenario you could possibly ever think of. Unlike dictatorships like Russia, the west tends to keep its tech under wraps as much as possible.  The weapons you know about today aren't the most advanced weapons the West has. We only bring out the new stuff when the situation is ideal for it or it is really need it. In this war alone we have ""POOFED""  a few new weapons(to the public) into existence. 
4. If Russia used nukes, Putin and his lackeys know it would be the end of their regime. He doesn't even have to have a successful launch. A failed launch will be enough. 
5. If nukes were used a coalition of other countries would invade Russia and secure all nuclear material and depose the Putin regime. The Russian military would put up little to no resistance and the civilians are unlikely to resist as well since they would be treated better by the invaders than their own government.",xdk9zr
"I remember the constant under current of fear of nuclear war growing up in the 60's/70's in the States as a kid. Then we all pretty much figured out it was a load of dick swinging crap put on us by politicians from both us and Russia. I don't fear it at all anymore. The world is crazy, but not that crazy.",xdk9zr
"Nah. I spent the first half of my life existing in the first 'cold war', and other than a few random moments of 'wow, wouldn't that be fucked up?' whenever i happened to think about the possibility of nuclear war, you just go on with your life and do what humans do. Ain't no different now. You can either go on about your business and live life, let it gnaw your brain into a quivering bowl of pudding, or buy an acre of land in Montana and become a prepper. I think i'll stick with the first option.",xdk9zr
All of Russia's elite's families live in the West. They would be killing their own families with their own strike. Not gonna happen.,xdk9zr
no,xdk9zr
"Back in the late 60's & early 70's, we used to practice nuclear ""duck and cover"" drills weekly in elementary school. We would hear the bell ring and we had to duck under our desks, cover our eyes and face away from the windows until we heard bell ring again. The teachers all had pictures of the students they were in charge of with the student's name, parent's names, phone number, and address written on the back. Nuclear fall-out shelters were commonplace in every major city. The small town I grew up in had a mine with enough supplies for 30 days for the entire population stored in it. This is what we grew up with back then (I'm 57) and because it was a part of our everyday life, we all accepted it as the norm.",xdk9zr
"Yep; roughly30 yars of living in fear of someone finally pushing the button; that's why stuff from the 70, 80s and part of the 90' is so bleak.

That sentiment was where escape from new york, red dawn, mad max, fist of the north star and others derive from; we were kind of certain the post apocalypse punk was going to be a reality, we just didn'tknow when.",xdk9zr
"you do realize anyone can launch a nuke at anytime right and have been your entire life.

its not like they invented nukes this year.

And if it goes down you wont have a say in the matter so why worry if it happens we are all dead.

But to set in perspective,you are on a ball of stone with crack lines fueled by magma in its core whirling around in an infinite space with meteors and stuff shooting around 24/7 and literally any day we could get hit by one and all die like the dinosaurs.

there is no point in worry about it because its not like we are in power over any of it.",xdk9zr
Im not concerned at all,xdk9zr
"I couldn't care about dying, for me the biggest fear I have is  not dying instantly and having to watch my children die whilst reassuring them that everything's okay. I couldn't think of anything worse.",xdk9zr

Typical Middle Eastern view - ‚Äùyea ‚Ä¶ Putin made some mistakes but it is America‚Äôs fault‚Äù - total crap,xxrz7t
"Yup. For the most part, on target or at least a valid middle Easter perspective. 
Except:

‚ÄúWhile Ukraine may have turned the tide for now, Russia has more than a few options, including the use of overwhelming airpower and tactical nukes.‚Äù

If Russia had overwhelming air power, they would have used it. They only had the image of that sort of capability. Underpowered Ukraine fought them to a standstill. Fully supplied Ukraine has made the sky over Ukraine a very dangerous place for Russian pilots. 

When it comes to tactical nukes, you only have to look at a map to see why they are not that valuable.  Certainly not considering the international backlash. Let‚Äôs imagine they had 20 tactical nuke size conventional weapons. What would they shoot to make a real difference?  The map is to big. Forces too spread out.",xxrz7t

Not saying it didn't get hit by artillery, we don't know from this video what caused it to catch on fire. It is a Soviet vehicle so it could have caught fire on its own.

"Man this article sounds like conspiracy theorists at work. It is blissfully ignorant of any event prior to 2022's invasion like how areas like Donbass came to be ""Russian majority"" regions. You can't grant Donbass or Crimea or anywhere else pro-foreign autonomy. That is naive to the extreme. There are a lot of fake articles but 5 mins research can tell you which threads end ubruptly and which ones continue to be reported on. Far more than just the ""western media"" are united on the issue of Ukraine. Any way you look at it, no matter who you are, putin has taken irreversible steps that will leave this world worse than he found it. People have likened him to Voldemort because the literal words coming out of his mouth sound like voldemort. Nobody made that up. From the very first day of putins 'special military operation but really invasion', the tone of the conflict has been set by verifiable fact. Like the fact that Russian state media has been pumping out the nonsense like a fire hose. ""President zelensky has fled ukraine"". Everyone else in the world knows zelensky remained in Ukraine and expects able bodied men to do the same. ""I need ammo, not a ride"". I find this article to be particularly egregious because it does what all good liars do. Tells truths without context and sows doubt by omission. This allows it to be written with apparent conviction while offering nothing to the conversation.",u13og4
"This article questions someone's claimed ethnicity because they don't speak a language and describes a ""walk out"" of the Greek parliament, when it was only 3 radical left politicians.

Great ""journalism"".",u13og4
Op whacks it to pictures of dogs,u13og4
"I read the article. It's trash, written by someone with a lot of ignorance and bias. Potentially russian troll-farm tripe. Not worth your time.",u13og4
"It's unfortunate that the author of this article did not feel it was necessary to source any of the claims. The purpose of the article is (presumably) to point out that there are two sides to the story, but there are *always* two (or more) sides to a story, and there is always propaganda during wars. It doesn't mean that the information from one side is not more reliable than the other. Since the author didn't cite sources for the claims he was comparing, it makes it very difficult to determine whether a claim has any merit.

That being said, from what I can find the source of reports supporting Russia's claims are almost always Russian state media, whereas the contrary is not true of media supporting the Ukrainian narrative: it's not just state media, there are countless, independent primary sources documenting what's happening.

For example, the bombing of the maternity hospital in Mariupol. While the author of this article doesn't cite what reports say ""the hospital was being used as a military base"", during research the only ones I could find were from Russian sources that had no primary sources cited. On the other hand, the reports saying that it WAS a hospital and many people were wounded or killed are supported by Associated Press reporters who were actually there, and filmed and took photos of the aftermath and the injured. Which one is more reliable: state media with no evidence, or people who were actually there and have photo, audio, and video evidence?

Similarly, Bucha. The article (again) doesn't cite the reports they are referring to, but the Russian claims that I have seen are that the bodies were put there after the Russians left. However, the [NY Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2022/04/04/world/europe/bucha-ukraine-bodies.html) and the [BBC](https://www.bbc.com/news/60981238) both have produced articles analyzing and authenticating satellite footage that directly contradicts the claims that the executions did not happen or were not committed by the Russians. ""The satellite images could be fake or altered!"", except they were taken by the private company Maxar, not a government, and they were cross referenced against the images from two OTHER private satellite companies (Planetlab and Apollo Mapping). So in order for this to be a lie, you either need all three satellite companies to not only be lying, but also have the foresight to know they would be the ones compared and alter all of their images before hand, OR you need both the BBC and the NY times, two independent media groups from different countries, to have lied about the results of their analysis. So who is more reliable: Russian media with no sources for their claims, or two independent media groups providing satellite images from a private company, that is verified against two other private satellite companies images, that show that Russia is lying?

As for the planes, well, there's a lot to unpack here. One, it is fairly ironic to claim that the western media is, as a unified whole, biased and not accurately portraying the war and, as one of your pieces of evidence, claim that the Ukrainian air force is gone and do so by citing... a [Forbes articles](https://www.forbes.com/sites/davidaxe/2022/04/07/where-are-ukraines-bombers/?sh=2b27267b6e7e), which is... a western media outlet. Womp womp. Though, at least the author cited something: this is the only claim that I noticed having a citation. Of course, this praise is tempered by the fact that the author misrepresents the report: The Forbes article doesn't say that ""the last time the government of Ukraine mentioned its jets was on March 2"" as claimed, it's actually specifically talking about the Su-24 bomber. The Forbes article goes on to say that it is clear that the Ukrainian air force clearly still has Su-27s and MiG-29s (though they are running out). It seems Sandipan Deb (the author) argued with themself, and lost. As an additional aside, there are countless videos and pictures and testimonies detailing the other parts of the Ukrainian air force: like the videos of the Ukrainian Helis that flew into Russia to destroy the Russian fuel depot on April 1st, or the constant drumbeat of TB-2 strikes taking out Russian armor and personnel.

The Russian convoy thing is also a somewhat silly argument. There convoy was stalled for about a week, this is clear from satellite footage. They also appeared to have rocket platforms with the convoy, which would be protection against them being ""sitting ducks"" against an air attack. The fact that the convoy wasn't destroyed is not an indication that the convoy was not delayed due to terrain, malfunction, etc.

""The unprecedented sanctions on Russia have not been as effective as the West may have imagined"" - Well the S&P Global purchasing managers‚Äô index has dropped 10% as of April 4th, Goldman Sachs forecasts a 10% contraction in GDP and the Institute for International Finance Projects 15% contraction. The Russian stock market is limited to only trading specific stocks. The Moscow Exchange Index is down 20% since the start of the invasion. The ruble has stabilized, but that's due to intense restrictions imposed by the central bank: companies must convert 80% of export revenues to the Ruble, there are high interest rates, and until recently there was a 12% fee to convert rubles to another currency. The 12% fee was removed recently, and the ruble dropped 15%.

Honestly, I initially wanted to give this article a fair shake, because I agree that the biases of the information sources do distort information by default, but this article seems to be pretty far off: few to no sources, bad arguments, and outright false in some cases.",u13og4

So he made up some BS reason to keep Ukraine in constant conflict to not allow it to take its oil revenues. Putin saw Ukraine as a vassal state and was no threat for this, but then Ukraine ousted the pro Russian president of Ukraine who was effectively keeping EU admission at bay under Putin's wishes and that changed the dynamics of it all.

"20k MPH isnt far beyond the limits of any country. Reentry vehicles can hit not to far off that and that is in parallel to the surface. It wouldn't be unreasonable that a country could get a speed of 20k or higher on reentry if they wanted too.

Disclaimer: Hundreds of Wagner Mercenaries were killed in the making of this video. Celebrations for visual effect only.,xizdt5
Looks like Daesh recruitment video with guns & explosion. But best part is the ‚Äúf*ck nazis‚Äù for a group founded by one,xizdt5
Am genuinely convinced that nation is definitely backwards.The shite they come out with.,xizdt5
"When they said cash , chicks ‚Ä¶.. why did they not show piles of money and hot naked strippers ?

Richard Wagner was hitlers favorite composer and was a known anti Semitic.  But yeah tuck nazis.  How many of those sheep forgot that part.,xizdt5
"Lol. Russian nazis from prisons, dancing in an recruitment ad featuring Ride of the Valkyries, by Hitlers favorite composer (Wagner,R.), while repeating ""fk nazis"" üòÜ I mean, how more stupid can it get?

70% og these guys in the vid are probably dead already üòÖ",xizdt5
"‚ÄúFuck nazis, but yeah we love listening to valkeries and our name is Wagner group.‚Äù

I never seen this level of blatant gaslighting, this is insane.",xizdt5
This video deserves NSFW tag more than dead orcs,xizdt5
Did I miss it or did they not mention the possibility of doing all the war crimes.,xizdt5
"Well, in Poland we have a small action to send them tons of fake enlistment applications to make their life harder - I encourage everyone to join ;)",xizdt5
"Might as well apply for assisted suicide instead, Wagner is in constant rebuild after its devastating losses",xizdt5
They make it look so fun to die,xizdt5
What‚Äôs that toy bear? Something stolen from a raped and murdered Ukrainian child most likely.,xizdt5
"Well. That was, something I just watched. So, killing people is like a dance party?",xizdt5
"They are trying to vibe like Ukrainian meme forces and again, failing miserably. A piss poor quality production, with an ugly hook.",xizdt5
I bet this is on high rotation at the next Wagner bush doof,xizdt5
well thats enough internet for me for today holysht,xizdt5
The text of the song is sounding like rap about gangsters. Cult about guns. I can't wait until they are put behind bars. Ukranian bars.,xizdt5
Wagner Group = **LAME AF**,xizdt5
"So ""–µ–±–∞—Ç—å –Ω–∞—Ü–∏—Å—Ç–æ–≤"" is not exactly ""fuck nazis"" but more of a literaly ""fuck with nazis""...maybe thats the reason there are not showing hot women in the add. Maybe this is signaling something more like russian prison tradition to fuck each other? Since the are the literal nazis here...",xizdt5
Slava Ukraini!,xizdt5
"Funny, they wanna be elite forces but their recruiting Pool is a prison ü§£",xizdt5
That looks like a very effective recruitment tool considering the kinds of dipshits Wagner is looking for.,xizdt5
"""raze everyone to the clean land""

This is satire... right? Right?",xizdt5
Lol the only nazis here are wagner n his soldiers invading,xizdt5
Lol ‚Äúfuck nazis‚Äù werent those your allies before they stabbed you in the back üòÇ,xizdt5
Someone should redo this with picture of all the dead and wounded and captured Wagners and see if can be distributed as well,xizdt5
This is total cringe video,xizdt5
"Correct me if I'm wrong, but the only way to dance with a valkyrie is if you're dead, right?
They don't appear to the living.",xizdt5
"I couldn‚Äôt watch or listen to the whole video. The music sucked and I was afraid the graphics were going to give me a seizure. 

Its crazy that these people are incompetent enough to think this passes as a recruiting video.",xizdt5
"Another round of ruzzians attempting authenticity and coolness but at best producing a phallic ending (no pun intended).

These parasites don‚Äôt have their own identity and of course ripped off images of our Ukrainian military playing instruments and dancing in the face of orc horror.",xizdt5
Is it normal to get motion sickness from watching utter shite like this?,xizdt5
Lol this is 100% cringe. Fuckin pathetic,xizdt5
If there ever is negotiations between the two counties again one stipulation for Ukraine should be Russia has to admit to being actual nazi‚Äôs and stop projecting,xizdt5
Would be great if we could get a professional video maker to counter this showing the mangled bodies of Wagner personnel and the effect they have had on civilians. I would suggest some backing music from a suutable death metal band.....,xizdt5
"Video should have a seizure warning tag, lol",xizdt5
Shittest video made by a 5 year old stupid fuck,xizdt5
"Popularisation of terrorism through mass media, very curious ü§î",xizdt5
This is like Hitler calling the allies Nazis....,xizdt5
"Yes commrades come join the Wagner group where you will serve alongside rapists, pedos, and other criminals fresh from the Gulag.",xizdt5
"This is cringe as fuxk, it looks like it was made by some edgy teen.",xizdt5
These guys got wrecked in Syria and Ukraine will be their final graves,xizdt5
Lol cringe,xizdt5
"Rap music, Hip-Hop was founded in the United States, later copied by European, Russian, Asian (Oriental) countries. For a country that hates the West, it's funny seeing them copy Western style music. That's just like when the orcs named their new flagship vehicle the ""Terminator"". I think everybody remembers how the orcs deployed 10 of them to Ukraine. BTW, anybody know what ever became of the ""Terminators"" lol? Anyways the orcs who hate the West ripped off a Hollywood blockbuster franchise new for an orc vehicle. Even in their victory day holiday I seen they had used images of American GI's with M1 carbines, Thompsons, and the iconic flag raising Iwo Jima photo as their own for posters and billboards for that holiday they celebrate.",xizdt5
Most of the wagner is nazi swastika loving sukas,xizdt5
"They are the Nazis. Maybe they like to think of themselves as the SS without saying that. The SS was more disciplined and more evil. These guys are a bunch of thugs, murderers, and mercenary‚Äòs they do it for the money for the thrill",xizdt5

They're actually equating anyone who identifies as Ukrainian, the entire Ukranian identity as nazi.

"Damn, I hope the pilot managed to eject in time and run back to Ukraines side",xik2we
Looks more like some sort of drone to me? But I could be wrong?,xik2we
"Some people here seem to think this is faked russian propaganda because we only see a couple of large pieces, no small pieces and no scorch marks. Here is why i think that this is unfortunately a real downed ukrainian aircraft:

When a plane breaks up high above the ground many large pieces are separated from the smaller pieces. These large pieces also have a lot of drag and don't impact the groud very fast. Also when a plane explodes/breaks not all parts catch on fire. Fire is only expected near fuel tanks and/or weapons.

Lack of craters and scorch marks does not mean this is faked (unfortunately). I'm not an air crash expert but tail and wing sections seem to survive more often judging from pictures i found.

Here are some pictures from other aircraft crashes to back this up:

[MH-17](https://i.guim.co.uk/img/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/7/22/1406053076486/0f381975-2c05-46f6-8a78-380854d9614e-2060x1236.jpeg?width=700&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=fe591f76e808707cb16edede5ef481c7) (hit by a missile at high altitude)

[Thai airforce F-16](https://i0.wp.com/cms.sofrep.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/c1_480080_150220200203_620x413.jpg?ssl=1) | [Another Thai F-16 (possibly  from the same one)](https://www.thaipbsworld.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/1646730674650.jpg)

[russian SU-25 in syria](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/DVIUOi_W4AEeJk3.jpg)

I also found pictures of what is commonly expected in an aircrash. Burned out wreckages with large craters and many small fragments.

[Plane that crashed into mountain](https://images.dailycaller.com/image/width=960,height=411,fit=cover,f=auto/https://cdn01.dailycaller.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/GettyImages-1240994997-scaled-e1653916820936.jpg)

[F-22](https://www.airforcetimes.com/resizer/8v1XgJynR7pXeuMH7WgxL-yuplw=/1024x0/filters:format(png):quality(70)/cloudfront-us-east-1.images.arcpublishing.com/archetype/NJ5HI7KSRNGTBGGWCMETEW37HM.png)

[Indian airforce Mig-21](https://images.moneycontrol.com/static-mcnews/2021/12/IAF-chopper-crash.jpg?impolicy=website&width=770&height=431)

However what all these aircraft seem to have in common is that they were in one piece when they hit the ground and crashed due to accidents. When an aircraft get hit by a missile its kinda  expected that it might not come down in one piece and that it gets spread over a large area.

It also looks like the aircraft isn't a drone. The pieces seem to be the tail of a reasonably big aircraft (judging by the shadow of the man in picture 2). The biggest drone I'm am aware of operating in ukraine is the [bayraktar](https://www.timesaerospace.aero/sites/aerospace/times/files/styles/lead_image_2_1280x720_/public/2022-04/1%29%20Bayraktar_TB2%20Bayhalukj.pg%20copy.jpg?itok=CAICWZut). But as you can see in the picture the bayraktar has a V shaped tail.

The markings on the wreckage also seem to match the tail of a [Ukrainian SU-25](https://www.redstar.gr/images/Aircrafts/Sukhoi/Su_25M1/Smal/Su_25M_1.png)

A sad event for Ukraine. Hope the pilot lives to fight another day.",xik2we

"Looks like they took pieces from a old wreck and just laid them out in a field . 
Going to call bs here .   

Guess we will see what Ukraine says about it .",xik2we
"This looks faked.  As others have already pointed out, the ground around doesn‚Äôt looked charred / burnt and there‚Äôs an obvious void of smaller pieces.  This looks like somebody sprinkled larger pieces collected from an old wreck to make it look like Russia just shot down another Ukrainian jet. 

I‚Äôve seen lots of propaganda posts on these subs this week in response to the Russian losses  in Kharkiv‚Ä¶and several of these posts have come from this account. 

It looks like the Kremlin has stepped up their efforts lately to make it look like they aren‚Äôt losing horribly.",xik2we

"To anyone wondering, what they are wearing, the hats, the beards and the uniforms are 1 to 1 renditions of Chetniks (ƒåetnici).

This was in WW2 a Nazi collaborative Serb monarchist paramilitary movement that apart from making a hobby for themselves of surrendering to the Partisans, was organized (genocide) killing nonserb nationals in Yugoslavia. Especially muslim Bosniaks of Bosnia. Their brutality and hatred echoes up to this day as their sons and grandsons did the same in the 90's in Srebrenica, Bosnia. The methods are the same, torture, slitting of the throat, raping daughters in front of their bound fathers and making them watch, raping wives, of said fathers in much the same way. Killing the children first and then the parents so the parents see their child dying as the last thing they see. Impaling people on spikes and roasting them like a lamb or pig roast above a fire. Cooking babies alive are just some of the documented war crimes in [WW2](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chetnik_war_crimes_in_World_War_II), or more recently [in the 90s in Bosnia](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bosnian_genocide#:~:text=The%20events%20in%20Srebrenica%20in,command%20of%20General%20Ratko%20Mladi%C4%87.) and methods of genocide of the Chetniks against mostly Bosniak civilians. As an army they never posed much threat as their speciality was hate crimes, rape and genocide against nonserbs. This should be an alarming news to the world that Serbs did not change (they still deny the Chetniks did anything wrong and are considered heroes of serbdom among any partially right leaning serb onwards) and are looking for blood again. Of course, not all Serbs are like this, but generally speaking, any mildly right leaning Serb and of course more, thinks like this.",ty8bz0

If the answer is no then there is little you can do in the 1 and 3 department.

The 2-nd is something that you can work on if you are with military experience or are a mercenary.  If you are an average person there is also little we can do to end the war alone.

I know this sounds cruel and you might think like I'm not thinking about people dying there but it's not a good time to end this war yet. Russia is not in bad enough position to negotiate a peace where they won't try it again in future.

&#x200B;

The only thing a person from ""neutral"" country can do is to send money and organise to push more military equipment into Ukraine. This way Ukraine can basically kill more Russians. If they kill enough people this will force Russia to try to negotiate a peace that let's hope will prevent future war from happening.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

As for the governments. It's hard to make them do more than they are doing right now. The only way for Russia to be truly fucked is to stop buying oil and gas from them. The problem is that some EU countries are too dependent on oil and gas and will not sanction it.

It's called being an idiot (I know that insulting is not the way to discuss some things but it's an opinion) for trusting a dictatorship and there is not much you can do about it as a normal person. It will take years to cut dependence on those resources and the only thing you can do is transfer to green energy.",uv4942

"65% aproved Putin administation before the war. I doubt that would change much now. Sanctions are hitting hard, but russians are being bombarded with fake news and propaganda. They must think they're winning a glorious war.",tb12i1
"There are several layers to it. There‚Äôs the false narrative that Russia fears Ukraine joining NATO. This is a lie on several grounds. Ukraine doesn‚Äôt intend to join NATO (that‚Äôs the first reason it‚Äôs a lie) and second, NATO isn‚Äôt a threat to Russia. 
Now that we cleared that up, let‚Äôs go and talk about the real issue. 
The real reason Russia (meaning Putin) hates Ukraine is because Vladimir Vladimirovich doesn‚Äôt want Ukraine to become a successful democracy. Any former soviet country that becomes a successful democratic state is a direct threat to Putin‚Äôs hold on power. Putin‚Äôs fear of democracy is so strong that he would use radioactive weapons to take out Russian democrats in foreign countries like Britain. 

The second reason is more ideological. Putin wants to reestablish the Russian empire. Not the USSR, but the Russian empire. He‚Äôs not a Bolshevik. Bolshevik were communists while Putin is an oligarch surrounded by other oligarchs. He‚Äôs more of a czarist. 

Putin (and many Russians) believe that Ukraine is rightfully Russia‚Äôs. He believes that Ukraine is ‚Äúmalorossiya‚Äù meaning ‚Äúlittle Russia‚Äù and he believes that the southern parts of Ukraine belong to Russia because Moscow was the power that originally conquered these areas and settled these areas with Russian, Ukrainians and other nationalities. 

Basically, Putin is driven by nationalism, and I do believe his nationalism is genuine. His Russian nationalism goes hand in hand with his desire to create an autocratic system of power in all territories that Russia has a historical claim to. 

He wants to take over Belarus too, and he succeeded. Belarus is now a puppet state of russia. Kazakhstan and Armenia are also deeply within the Russian sphere of influence. Parts of Georgia (Osettia and Abkhazia) too. 

The only territories that Putin/Russia want that are outside his sphere, are Ukraine, the Baltic states, some Central Asian states (like Azerbaijan) and what‚Äôs remaining of Georgia.",tb12i1
"1. Putin believe that there is Facists in the Ukranian gvorment that cut russians rights by bombing Donbass (thats funny how he does not even care about his country) 

2. Putin believe that Ukraine wants to join NATO and then America will place its military nearbly russian borders.

He just want to stop it",tb12i1
"This is like asking why the nazis hated the jews so much. I don't care anymore, russia is wrong and needs to be stoped.",tb12i1
Putin lives in the Cold War and imagines all out war between nations is still a significant risk,tb12i1

"I grew up in 60‚Äôs and 70‚Äôs.  I felt two things. Nuclear war could happen. Or I could grow up and get drafted and sent to Vietnam, I thought about this when I was 10.

Nukes you can‚Äôt worry about cause you can‚Äôt do anything about it.  Just hope defense is up to par.
Just look up MAD regarding nuclear war.",tau7ix
"Yes.

But...

Consider this; Putin cannot launch a nuke on his own. Putin's generals need to agree to it too. When they all give the order, the messenger must agree to it too. When the commanding officer in charge of the nukes receives the orders, they must agree to it too. The actual technicians who have to input the target and push the launch button must agree to it too.

At any stage a person could say ""wait, no, fuck this."" and considering all the people involved would be quite aware this means total and complete annihilation, assuming those involved have families and loved ones, I think the chance is pretty high that a direct order to launch a nuke could be ignored somewhere down the line.

Besides that...

Look at the state of Russian military equipment. It's old and unkept. I wouldn't put it beyond Russia that their nukes are in the same state.",tau7ix

Russia has already isolated itself from majority of the world. I feel if they use nukes they risk angering China.,tau7ix

Do you I think it will have dire consequences?  Yes

The question really comes down to should they impose a ‚Äòno fly zone‚Äô despite the consequences?  No, it would lead to WWIII.",t9gal6
"No. It would lead quickly to direct engagement between Russia and NATO, and this would put all of Europe under attack and essentially create global world war III. Russia does not have air superiority right now, and Ukrainian forces will be able to impose almost a complete no fly zone anyway once there are enough stinger missiles in the country, and we are already almost there. Unfortunately we cannot do anything about missiles at this point, but a no-fly zone may not help with that anyway. ... And a second thought: maybe Putin would like to see a no-fly zone because that kind of provocation and escalation would give him an excuse to expand the war and take attention away from his disastrous defeat that is slowly unfolding. So we should not let him do this under any pretext.",t9gal6
"Should we deliver weapons? Yes.

Should we engage with russians troops directly? Yes and no. I believe, should the increased violence towards civilians get worse.

"No. Haven't seen much evidence if the Russian airforce and most of the action is on the ground. The only hope Ukraine has of driving them back is if Poland gives them the mig 29s and they get more drones, which have been a huge success.

The long term? I think Russia will not be able to hold onto the land it tries to steal. I think partisans will play a big role in this. I see sanctions not being lifted until Russia leaves Ukraine. I see North Korea 2.0 for Russia. No future with Putin or his cronies.,v9jmwn
"Russia won‚Äôt win because their LOSS benefits ALL the economies of the free world-especially those that want cheap fuel. Russia will already be paying for what they have done in Ukraine for centuries and Russian leadership will extract that cost from their own peoples cheap labour.

Frankly the Russians should be banging down the doors to the Kremlin and dragging Putin out into the street. He and he alone is throwing their futures away‚Ä¶ for what?",v9jmwn
"Russia will eventually mobilise (officially or not) enough men and become component or overwhelming enough to take more land.

Their strategy to level cities will continue as then they do not need to subdue the local populous and anyone left in the cities they can assume is a combatant and shoot. 

America realises (if they have not already)  that if Russia does not get stopped in Ukraine the next stop is a NATO nation then a humiliating defeat of Russian forces and retreat to their boarders or further up the anti with Nukes. 

Poland goes fully nuts and takes on Russia by themselves, after delivery of further square grid removal systems. 

France accidentally surrenders to itself after misdialing and calling a internal number instead of Putin, ironically after supplying such a lethal amount of weapon‚Äôs it turns the tide of the war. 

China waits until Russias collapse and fragmention into seperate autonomous regions and invades from the east taking back lands Russia Stole 200 years ago. 

Seven years after the war Germany delivers its first large batch of heavy weapons to Ukraine. The delay was due to the lights going out due to Russian gas pipelines going offline and incorrect paperwork which was finally filled out correctly.",v9jmwn
"Putin will die.

Russia will  go back to the 90's chaos.

Ukraine recover it's legal borders after russians retreat.",v9jmwn
"Russia loses...but there will be a huge cost to both Ukraine and Russia. This war will soon devolve into an artillery driven battle slowly pushing Russian forces back to the Russian Border. Once there is no hope of stopping the Ukrainian advance, the Russians will likely engage is a more rapid retreat.

There is a 25% chance of retaking Crimea. Ukraine may be too exhausted to achieve that goal. On the other hand, Russia maybe too exhausted to stop them.

Of course, Russia will have been bled white by the loss of men and material. If the Putin aligned politicians are not overthrown after his death, then a new dark age will descend upon Russia. They will have to Stalinize the country to stay in power. The economy will take 25 years or more to recover.

There will be a de facto purge of Russian sympathizers from Eastern Ukraine. Russian language speakers will probably only speak Ukrainian outside of their front door. Most of the East will become an armed camp awaiting the next Russian invasion. 

Huge war crime trials will occur at the Hague and in Kyiv, but very few will ever be fully prosecuted. Only a handful of the expatriated (to Russia) Ukrainian men, women and children will ever be seen again. Those who are refugees may, or may not, return.

Your guess is as good as mine what happens in Belorussia.

It may take close to half a Trillion USD to rebuild Ukraine, if not more. The upside being a far more technologically advanced Eastern Ukraine.

These are just predictions from an old guy who studies wars as a hobby, so take it with a 'grain of salt.'",v9jmwn
"I think that‚Äôs always been their goal. Annex Donetsk and Luhansk as they did with Crimea. They also saw an opportunity to launch an offensive in the north to occupy the capitol and topple their so-called nazi regime. As we saw, that didn‚Äôt work. My unprofessional opinion is that they‚Äôre just going to work to secure the coastline, and then secure the rest of their holdings in the east. Then they‚Äôll claim it as mission accomplished.

I *do not think*, however, that the Russian people are going to overthrow their government. To make that call this early would be a bit drastic. I think it all depends on how long Putin lives. When he‚Äôs gone I‚Äôm sure he will have chosen his replacement, so it‚Äôs a matter whether that person is better or worse than Putin. If they‚Äôre worse than Putin, it could force a revolution. That is for the sole purpose of prolonged suffering.",v9jmwn
The decay of the Russian army and will to fight along with popular opinion in Russia will create discontent and they will eventually fall apart.,v9jmwn
"Russia will embarss itself, economic disaster will follow it. Russia will shatter into multiple smaller countries run by some fuckwits. 

To avoid this the russians should already be making plans for a better tommorrow for their country.",v9jmwn
"russia is not a stable country, it has 200 ethnic groups, and almost all their borders have smoldering conflicts. They only have 3 export products: Fossil fuels, grain, and weapons.

They had a chance to become rich bc of their large fossil reserves, but that moment is passing really, really quickly. Fossil fuels are on the way out, and russia will be stuck with their vast reserves. There will be no European buyers ever again.

Grain is easily produced by a lot of other countries, especially for the cuurent higher prices.

And arms... Even India is dropping russian weapons (purchase went from 75% to 45%) IIRC. The whole russian industry is highly dependent on Western parts and machinery. Plus, after this war russia needs to rearm itself, so the export is needed for their own army. Which makes them highly unreliable.",v9jmwn
"Putin will die very soon, either from sickness or from drinking a cup of tea‚Ä¶this will enable Russia to retreat their troops to save face and blame it all on Putin to end sanctions and isolation. Ukraine will take back all their stolen land, rebuild, join EU and NATO‚Ä¶and Russia will eventually fall apart into different ethnocentric independent republics.",v9jmwn
Nato will be involved by the end of the year.,v9jmwn
"The future is quite scary. The delicate balance of peace has been shattered. Putin will die but who replaces him? Any new leader isn't just going to give up the lands stolen in Ukraine - they would probably be overthrown by pro Putin factions if they did as it would be seen as a massive humiliation. Ukraine isn't going to settle for that long term either even if there is a ceasefire / peace settlement. Russia will bleed though insurgency in its gained territory and the economic sanctions (which take time to really hurt) could result in a worse regime than Putin's coming to power in the future. The rise of Hitler, Japan's entry into WW2 - all borne from perceived humiliation and economic sanction. In the future, Ukraine, having built up its military capabilities with the help of the West could launch an attack on Crimea and the Donbass and start another war all over again. Pretty depressing stuff to be honest. Our only hope is that Russian youth, with greater access to information outside Russia is less indoctrinated and opts to create a better Russia - one less concerned with imperialism and more concerned with the quality of life of its citizens and the global community.",v9jmwn
"It's not about NATO, nazis, Banderas or other lame excuses. It's about transit pipes and establishing control over gas and oil. If oil price brakes, which it might as some sort of recesion is looming on horizon, then Russia will retreat or atleast stop and establish control over won territory.

Depends on the oil price when this war ends.",v9jmwn
"I see ruzzia destroyed by sanctions, torn to pieces, poor, unarmed or the wars propaganda and killing will definitely continue. No mercy this time this is fascist scumbags state.",v9jmwn
"Russia securing lands such as LDPR and Kherson with Zhaporyzhe (theyll never left it since Kherson = water supplies for Crimea which were cut for almost 8 years by Ukraine, Zhaporyzhe = ZNPP), offensive in east frontline, maybe attempts to capture also whole coast (Mykolaev, Odessa).
Sanctions will stay even after Putin leaves, because Russia is not Putin, its people living there. Maybe theyll finally start to produce their own tech since theres lots of resources there. Relations with West go OOOF. New crisis.
Ukraine spending time awaiting for joining EU, billions spend to rebuild what was destroyed by war, partially by Russians (theyve already admitted that), partially by Western coalition. But still itll be very, very hard times for the country for a couple of years min.",v9jmwn
"The russian people will overthrow their dictator with the Free russia battalion legion. The  anti war resistance partisans within russia, whom love a nicotine break  and accidentally cause special fire operations, as the winds blow hard in all the directions  of the troops food, fuel and ammunition depots. Thus the free russian people stop the war as they all finally realise that their 1919 revolution that their ancestors fought because of lack of food and war has started again and needed them all to revolt to stop this NaZi war against Ukraine.",v9jmwn
Ukraine will win.  How?  That's the secret part...,v9jmwn
WW3,v9jmwn
Russia will win.  It will keep what it has now.  Maybe a bit more if the war drags on,v9jmwn
"Russia is no stranger to revolutions. Three in the 20th century. I predict a fourth in the 21st century. This war will drag on for a while. The UAF is already strategizing into the winter months of 2022. It won‚Äôt be an easy victory for Ukraine but I believe that as long as their will power to stay free remains, along with western weapons distribution, they will pull through just like the Taliban in the 80s. The United States has lost wars to lesser equipped countries because of the lack of will power. But, couple up will power with modern  weaponry and skill, things will look good for Ukraine.",v9jmwn
"The Ukrainians has great military support but they have already mobilized the population, the economy is destroyed by invasion. In the same time Russia is fighting with its regular army with some number of volunteers but it also has economic troubles. But they didn't mobilized the economy and population. I think people somewhere in Moscow or other big cities don't know real situation on front lines and live as nothing had happened. That's why Ukraine has much less chances to win. Russia isn't exhausted by the war now",v9jmwn
"Russia is going to be greedy and tries to annex whole ukraine, he is not going to succeed and would eventually withdraw of some sort because of the mess in his own country.

But still lot of dead civilians and ukrainen soldiers. 
And a lot of dead orcs. 
No one will win in the end.",v9jmwn
Its their Afghanistan redo.,v9jmwn
"Russians will permanently secure Donbas, Crimea and a smaller land-bridge in-between. They‚Äôll give up Kherson but will retain control of the dam that supplies water for Crimea. In exchange, Ukraine will be accepted into NATO (security guarantee) and put on the path to EU membership (economic security)",v9jmwn
"Putin will die (if it's true he has advanced cancer) by the end of this year, a few months after his 70th birthday.  But another maniac will take over and escalate this war further, planning something for early spring 2023.  In the meantime, this maniac will do a general mobilization, and will order more airstrikes against Ukraine.  Like, real shock and awe.  Think Dresden firebombing, or Tokyo firebombing.

He will order a ""special military operation"" against one or more countries that have been the biggest supporters of Ukraine.  I'm thinking Poland, but it could be the Baltic countries as well.  The goal would be to punish these smaller countries that support Ukraine; they'd have their sights set on Czechia and Slovakia as well, maybe even Romania too.  Does the maniac care about Article 5? No.  He wants a full confrontation with the ""great Satan"", as payback for the collapse of the USSR.

As part of the newest ""special military operation"", there's airstrikes on multiple US/NATO bases.  US service members get killed.  The American people are outraged and want revenge against Russia.  Our congress declares war, which they haven't done since 2003, the last big war which had wide bipartisan support.  For President Biden, this has been a godsend, because anger and rage against him due to supply chain shortages and inflation have tanked his approval ratings.  His party also lost big time in the mid-term elections of November 2022.  But if there's one thing that gets bipartisan support, it's war against an evil enemy.  And Russia is our biggest enemy right now.

NATO is now fully mobilized, with all members ready to fight Russia.  Even France and Germany.  Airstrikes are immediately launched on Russian military bases; Kaliningrad gets hit hardest since it's the closest base to NATO countries that border it.  NATO makes it a point to not hit civilian targets, so Moscow and St. Petersburg are unscathed for now.  NATO naval forces move in to surround the Russians in the Black Sea; no matter what transpires, Russian warships will get uber f\*\*\*ed.  Crimea is also fair game for bombardment.  The bridge is taken out finally, and Sevastopol and other bases get smashed.

What about actual troops? Will they go into Ukraine? Hell yeah they will, and the Ukrainians will jump for joy, because now they can finally push Russians back after fighting them for over a year! Where will they go first? Hard to say, I'm just speculating anyway.  It will probably be the south first.  Ukraine has made some steady gains from Kherson on wards, but it has been slow going, because most of their manpower is concentrated in the east.  Russians did not give up on Severodonetsk even though they have lost a lot of troops and equipment there.  Unfortunately Ukrainians have also sustained heavy losses and have not been able to fully commit to counteroffensives in the south.  NATO will do that job.  They fully liberate Kherson, all of it.  Then they move to Melitopol, and reach Mariupol.  NATO also sends troops to the east, and help the weary Ukrainians push Russians back to 2014 lines.  All in all, this will take about as much time as it took the US to carry out their Persian Gulf campaign in 1991.

What will happen next? Who knows.  I fear the maniac could use nuclear bombs.  That's the big wild card.

I have no military background so it's hard to say what NATO will do first to tackle the problem of Russia in Ukraine.  But here's my 2 cents.",v9jmwn
"Ukraine finally blows Crimea Bridge. Russia looses the port city to Ukraine and some of the captured land. A fake boarder is agreed upon, but must all be returned to Ukraine. Putin coup takes place, non military leader who wants peace comes to power in Russia.",v9jmwn
"""P.S. I do hope that Ukraine will get enough weapons to liberate all of their territory."" Yeah, and keep killing pro-russian civilians, and enforce racist laws in their territory.  


I'm not saying that Russia is the good guy. Russia is a mf. But Ukraine too.",v9jmwn
"Russia will win and Ukraine will give back the 50 billion back to the US, which will lower rent and gas prices and thing will go back to normal.",v9jmwn

"If anything like that happened - I think it‚Äôd be a low yield airburst in the sea (no real risk of radiation fallout or casualties) to display resolve and willingness to go that far. It‚Äôll either break the West‚Äôs will or Ukraine‚Äôs will. 
The Israeli arrow is ICBM intercept capable upon atmospheric re-entry but even if it 1% of them fail to intercept and over 2,000 warheads are launched from RUS alone, you‚Äôre still looking at 20 warheads breaching their targets. Anything in the MT yield is overwhelming in comparison to Hiroshima/Nagasaki. 
Then there‚Äôs potentially a retaliatory strike - NATO/US/Rogue responses that make any landfall on RUS or it‚Äôs allies will eventually spread to the whole world. It becomes everyone‚Äôs problem‚Ä¶ 
The problem since the 50‚Äôs has been: do we strike now, risk it all, and stop this from ever becoming an issue in the future - or do we hope cool heads and peace talks secure the future. What if RUS is significantly more capable 10 years from now? China? Iran? NK? Every Sid Meier‚Äôs game ends in nuclear catastrophe. 
The other influences are purely political. Nearly all Western countries governments benefit from these ‚Äòenemies‚Äô in some form or fashion - whether it‚Äôs kids on a board of directors, leases, minerals, etc. look at how many people in US Congress alone moved their money out of BlackRock before the sanctions ($B worth). They won‚Äôt openly or willingly risk losing their money, power, and connections for war. 
Conspiracies abound, I don‚Äôt really care about those - but the morality is open to interpretation and there‚Äôs things we just don‚Äôt know about on both sides and has always been that way since always. We‚Äôre just more aware thanks to our digital, live connections to the world today. 
So yes, ultimately, I think it‚Äôll end in a singular or dual display. It won‚Äôt be battlefield deployment - it‚Äôll be testing deployment - to prove ‚Äòwe‚Äôve still got it‚Äô. RUS will go first, and US will respond with a test as large or larger than RUS detonation‚Ä¶ which will hopefully get enough global attention to shut this shit down. Don‚Äôt forget - almost everyone alive right now in our governments have never seen a detonation in the flesh or live-streamed. Only heard of them in their history classes or watched grainy film. Maybe Putin‚Äôs seen one from afar - but I would think 99% have not. And it‚Äôll remind everyone that it truly should be avoided, regardless of chest thumping cultures.",tgybrf

"Specifically the  Ukraine war? No, there is too much reluctance on the side of NATO to provoke it, and it is too close to all the territory Russia wants to control to be a good idea in the long run. 

Will it happen in our lifetime? Gods I hope not, but no nation builds weapons with the view they will never use them - they build them in case they need them; the problem is that we dont all share the same definition of ""just in case"".

If Ukraine falls and Russia turns hey eye elsewhere then all bets are off. Everyone says ""Putin won't do that"" or ""NATO won't do this,"" but the truth is we don't know anything about what anything will do for certain; let's face it, most of us didn't think he would go into Ukraine in the first place.

If he loses and is pushed back by the Ukranians I genuinely have no idea what Putin would do. Depends how he can spin it I reckon.

We avoided nuclear war back in the day because *one Russian* refused to launch from a sub until orders were confirmed. One man. That's way too close for comfort, and we can't be sure that will always be the case; next time that dude might be shot for insubordination and brainwashed drones hit the button. Shit, you only need to look at what people in cults will do to realize that people are unpredictable as fuck  Atrocities are committed all the time, so we can't guarantee that MAD will keep someone from acting. It hasn't done so before.

Personally I don't think NATO should have declared they wouldn't go into Ukraine in any circumstances, because Putin saw that as weakness. This does not mean I think NATO troops should be committed right now, or even ever, but I do believe that by taking it off the table completely, it let Russia to do what the fuck they want indefinitely. We don't know how far Putin will go, and we don't know if he cares about burning the world down or sacrificing the whole of Russia to his own ego. 

Honestly, the best hope for de-escalation is from inside Russia, not without. A coup by a more moderate group if we are lucky.

Probably controversial, but I don't believe NATO's actions either way will ultimately influence whether nuclear war happens, because a man willing to threaten it openly doesn't strike me as a man who is worried about what the world thinks of him, only what Russia thinks, and he can easily lie to them already. Putin will do what he wants and what his yrs Men tell him he will get away with, regardless of the truth.",tgybrf
"Call me an idealist but I can see several opportunistic separatist uprisings within Russia coupled with general civil unrest, empty shelves, a penniless government and a massive shift in attention away from the Ukrainian theatre which ends up stranding thousands of Russian troops in Ukrain, leaderless, unpaid and                   un-supplied, leading them to surrender in their droves and return to a Russia in flames and tearing itself apart! üòÜüëçüèª",tgybrf
"Who knows, we have absolutely no clarity on the point of view of the officers that would carryout such orders.  Nor do we know if Russia can launch nukes.  Many of Russia's current failures may stem from corruption.  Would said officer corp launch faulty missiles that may only destroy a few dozen western cities knowing that NATO will pave Russia with nukes killing your nation and ethnicity forever?  If the military and FSB get an impossible order or must reveal they have been stealing from Putin the easy answer would be to overthrow him.",tgybrf

"This mural isn't a kumbaya moment, or the artist just wanting both sides to ‚Äúhug it out.‚Äù This, I very much believe, is a pro-russia artist who wants Ukraine to call a ceasefire and stop fighting without russia having to pay or perform any reparations whatsoever. 

Look at how it is framed: The Ukrainian soldier is completely faceless and hidden. The russian has an eye and a hand visible, instantly humanizing him and urging the viewer to show empathy and compassion. 

This wants to show that it's not the russian soldier‚Äôs fault ‚Äî  he was ‚Äújust‚Äù following orders (see how well that argument went for the Nazis on trial at Nuremberg) ‚Äî so the Ukrainian should forgive, plain and simple. 

As rendered, it completely negates the Ukrainian‚Äôs agency as a sovereign people and nation who have the right to live as they choose in peace. It denies the Ukrainian‚Äôs humanity and sovereignty just as it reaffirms the russian‚Äôs. 

It's unbelievably offensive, and I hope folks in Melbourne get as angry as I am right now.",x4tk5d

Reminder: Part of living in the free world is being forced to tolerate something like this. It's not graphic, it's not violent, it's not sexually explicit, it's not a nazi symbol... it doesn't tick any of the boxes which would push it into the area where it could be banned.

"So all Russians are just evil? Doesn‚Äôt seem like most of them even understand what‚Äôs really going on.

The downside of having a poorly educated population.",x4tk5d
"I like the quote ""reconciliation must be as deep as the split"".

In this spirit I see some good meaning in this picture. For example: Russian people - defeated, ruined economically and politically finally look at itself in the mirror and is just terrified - in this sense.

If it is just shallow ""let's stop shooting"" - then it is indeed ridiculous and dangerous",x4tk5d
Sumo wrestling?,x4tk5d
"I think if this is offensive to you, you definitely don‚Äôt understand the meaning although this can be depicted based on the viewers opinions. 

In my eyes perhaps in a non bias look it‚Äôs a Ukrainian forced by opposition to defend his homeland and a Russian who was conscripted by force to be used as cannon fodder.

Again this is a matter of viewers opinion obviously Russians are in the wrong right now.

In a bias point of view This could also just be seen as Russian propaganda if you are Ukrainian or Ukrainian propaganda if your Russian. Fact is people who support Russia outweighs the ones who dont. So murals like this are usually not appreciated IMO",x4tk5d
It‚Äôs clearly a Ukrainian soldier stabbing a Russian soldier.. chill.,x4tk5d

Maybe it is a Russian soldier surrendering to a Ukrainian soldier.,x4tk5d
"The knives in their hands are not visible from this angle.

Jokes aside: This is indeed a very stupid piece of art at this point.",x4tk5d
"Chill bro, there are enough soldiers in the Russian army with the right sense to know all this is nonsense. Particularly in the beginning quite a few surrendered as soon as they were able to.",x4tk5d
"Aaaw, the Russian one looks very remorseful about his war crimes",x4tk5d
"This is not ridiculous nor disgusting. Every soldier, in every war throughout history was a person, before he was a soldier. As such, his personality and his spirit went with him to the battle and its perfectly natural to look for affection, regardless the justification of his actions as a soldier. This painting depicts his actions as a human being. I recommend on reading Erich Remarque's 'All quiet on the western front' - a remarkable novel which deals with these exact moral issues. 

With all being said, I strongly condemn Russia's terrible military actions against the people of Ukraine and against the state's sovereignty.",x4tk5d

Putin won't use nukes, he would have used them by now and didn't.",xats9u
"Russia won't use nukes. The U.S. and the west have implied that they'd retaliate against Russia for that.

What worries me more is that Russia will start saying ""peace, peace, peace!"" to end the war. Europe wants Russia to turn the gas back on, so they and the U.S. will pressure Ukraine to accept a ""deal"" that gives away Crimea and more. ""Peace"" will be declared, sanctions against Russia will end, and things will go back to normal, with no long-term punishment for Putin and Russia for their murderous invasion.",xats9u
"I really don‚Äòt see it. The ""nuke something‚Äú just for what? Item.

I asked myself how far ahead goes the planing on the actual offensive?
I assume (without any evidence) they planned to liberate Kharkiv oblast.
Done by today.
So I assume further the next step is to consolidate those gains.
Don‚Äòt forget, they are now at the border with Russia in that region. They have to secure their flanks.
Some troops may enter further settlements in the luhansk and Donezk region.
However, I think that is not sustainable at this point and more of a momentum.
Again, it depends how far the general staff had planned ahead. I mean planned in detail and to stay.",xats9u
"No way they are going to use any nukes.

"There won't be any nuclear strikes.   The Russian war propaganda is pure bullshit and the reasons given for the invasion are not the reasons the war happened.     Russia is run by Oligarchs, not politicians.  The Oligarchs don't give AF about the rhetoric and ideology of politicians, they care about personal wealth and power. No politician is in Duma without connections to these people.   

  What does a nuclear strike do for the Oligarchs? Makes them, their families and their enterprises targets for the most extreme sanctions ever seen. They don't want this.   The war failed, their hopes of securing valuable assets in Ukraine and further global power projeciton are out the window. Next step for them is to end the war and cut their losses, which will likely include removal of Putin, who will be had up on trumped up charges of treason, corruption and sending tens of thousands of Russians to their deaths.",xats9u
I also worry about this.,xats9u
"I think they have said they would consider using them if there was an existential threat against Russia. Luhansk and Donetsk declare themselves breakaway regions and not part of Russia so if they collapse and revert to Ukraine it seems to not apply to that thinking.

I suspect the return of all citizens will be one of the points demanded before the west lifts sanctions on Russia.,ubc7ym
"Firstly, the war hasn't turned to Ukraine's favor quite yet. There are a lot of good things happening, and some successful counterattacks in places, but until the russians are fully rocked back on their heels and turned away from any further offensive progress, i'd say it's still 'teetering' at this point.

As for the war ever going on to russian soil, that would clearly be a nuclear trigger point for the Kremlin, not going to see it. Don't mistake how this war may end for some carbon copy of how WW2 was resolved- it won't be.",ubc7ym
"It‚Äôs nice to see the heavy weapons flowing into Ukraine now. We will likely see the Russian losses start to accelerate in the coming months along with morale dropping and the Russian economy imploding into the summer. The stage is set, this started out as a David vs Goliath conflict but every day that passes Ukraine become more of a favorite to serve Russia an outright defeat. I‚Äôm hoping they are able to wipe out the entire Russian military stationed in and around Ukraine, every vehicle, weapon and troop, so Russia has zero ability to wage a war against another country.",ubc7ym
"I think it's a little early to be raising the victory flag... It'd be nice, but I worry we still haven't seen all of what Russia has to offer.",ubc7ym
[deleted],ubc7ym
"I can't see this ending anything like WWII. 

I can't see it ending in a total Russian victory either. So in that sense you're right that the tide has turned.

The most likely scenario is that with western backing Ukraine drives Russia out to the February borders. Reconquering all of Donbas and Crimea could happen if Russia's army completely collapses. If it doesn't, Ukraine will probably be ok with a diplomatic settlement with the pre-war borders. Especially Crimea is very pro-Russian and getting them back to under Ukrainian rule might not be a good idea. Yanukovich got elected mainly by the votes from these areas. Isn't it better for the future of Ukraine to have unity instead of a bit of piece of land? Furthermore, if Russian army doesn't collapse, it would take a lot of Ukrainian blood to get that land back.

Going all the way to Moscow is totally out of question. Ukraine has no interest to that as they are not as imperialist as Russia is. NATO is not going to do it because of Russian nukes (which it will definitely use if someone threatens to conquer it). The best case scenario is a Russian military defeat followed by a coup or a revolution in Russia that will put in power some more democratic leadership than what's there now. But I'm not holding my breath for this either.

Regarding the kidnapped people, Ukraine can demand their return as a condition for peace. The West can also easily put their return as a condition for the removal of sanctions. So, I'm not too worried about them in long term (short term, yes).",ubc7ym
Until nato joins or gives UA jets‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs going to get worse,ubc7ym
"The tide clearly didn‚Äôt turn until the second offensive has been dealt with. It didn‚Äôt even start yet. Two major offensive operations should start within days, one towards Odessa out of Kherson area and one towards Zaporizhzha from direction of Melitopol. Rusians seems to be having some success in Donbas region also - trying to encircle Severodonetsk, slowly moving towards Kramatorsk.

Nothing is clear just yet",ubc7ym

The Russian invasion was a genocide and attempt at cultural erasure from the start.,xf5wsq
This sounds like a Qanon theory that should not be equipped with legs.,xf5wsq
"Wait, did Q say something?",xf5wsq
"I think it was both the land and kids but they couldn't achieve one then changed the way they are doing the second. If this was the blitzkrieg that they had hoped then there would be no need for filtration because the traitors would send kids to Russia voluntarily. There are of course other reasons but that's not the topic but we can talk about them if you want.

Russian population is declining which is bad for multiple reasons but how do you counter that ?

 Well Putin couldn't think of other ways to do this other than invasion. They steal the kids when they are young so they can ""educate"" them into being Russia. 
I heard about some kids from Poland being taken into Nazi families because some of them wanted kids. It is possible that Russians are thinking that this will work the same way.



In my humble opinion the thing about mass executions is something like this. 

When adults resisted then the executions begin but it's also the by product of indoctrinating your population that there are Nazis in Ukraine. A simpleton from Russia will think that this is true and they hate the Nazis very much so they will let this hate go out by executing people. 

I'm not saying that this is what happened but that's my opinion.",xf5wsq
"Stupid operation; even if they stole twice the number of children than their reported losses; and even if they had half the losses... it's idiotic, it's gonna be at least 10 years before those kids are ""useful"" for anything.",xf5wsq
"Yesterday I've watched polish mil blogger Jaros≈Çaw Wolski on yt. He had a video about demographics of Ukraine. Contents are just... mind blowing. Basically Ukraine, after USSR dissolution had 52 mln people. Before the war, without donbas separatists it was 37 mln. From being 1,5 times bigger than Poland it became nearly the same size of pop. Going further: in 90s and 2000s most of Ukraine youth and soviet people emigrated to Russia for work and life. After 2014 dynamic changed, and most people go to Poland and then to other EU states. That's massive loss of working age and specialist people.  Right now Ukraine have 11 mln of retirement people. This is basicly a society that became old, before had chance to enrich itself. For comparison Poland has 6 mln of people on retirement. As difference in wealth between west and Ukraine grows, difference between Poland and west shrinks. Russia is not better. In 2019 300k more people died than was born. In 2020 it was 600k. In 2021 it was already 1 mln people. Russia is on downward spiral. Putin was probably counting for Ukraine to fill the demographic count. And now conclusion: because of the influx of refugees from Ukraine, polish demographics problems have been solved for next 10 years. There was a massive grassroot movement (and our stupid gov was only trying to mess this up) to quickly acomodate refugees here, to find them jobs (for instance my older brother let an apartment for women from Kharkiv, free of charge; I was in network that was recomending ukrainians for jobs in IT like testers and software developers - few of them were hired). Only one poll made shortly after war started said that 70% of ukrainians want to go back. After that most polls say it's 50/50. After war, most ukrainian soldiers will just go to live with their families in Poland (as harsh as this is, this will be probably the case). So both Ukraine and Russia lost the war. Ukraine demographics problems were again accelerated, not to mention destroyed infrastructure and stolen land. Russia will not get new citizens to fill the gap. They are literally meat grinding production age males not only from Russia, but also from ""freshly liberated"" territories. There will be only old people there in the end. Not to mention loosing entire specialist segment of workforce, that run abroad when war started. Poland, as harsh as it is (and I'm saying this as polish citizen) is only winner of this war. If Russia wanted all them kids, they are in Poland now.

"**German here** for some clearance:

To explain how something like this is possible.

German constitution protects the freedom of speech and freedom to protest for everyone. If a protest march is announced to the officials they have limited options to forbid these protests. This does not mean they allowed it but they can only prevent it if the protest would be endangering public safety or the object of the protest would be a crime in itself. So the simple support of russia by german law is not a crime. If they would have supported openly and directly the murdering of people in Ukraine or preached hate against Ukrainians or any other people the officials would be really happy to block this.

But as long as they do not make something illegal there is little that can be done other than organizing an anti war protest and blocking their own protest. This is very hard to do if this protests are announced on short terms.

Sad but true but I can assure all here that Germans are also very disgusted by this behaviour.

We hope that the government will finaly stand up with a total blockade of russian banks companys and goods.

I personally will accept and not moan about a loss of wealth just to show russia that they are currently the Nazis of Europe.

"Been watching the whole war, the way I‚Äôve been seeing tanks destroyed is one of three, ATGM, Drone, or good old fashioned tube artillery. 

It has its place as it has had for centuries, cheap mobile and effective.

I guess you could say that yes tube artillery is in more of a transitional phase, where it is becoming more of a frontline/middle line system. With the long range options sitting in the back where artillery used to.",wdf6s0
"No, because not all war is about precision. Sometimes you just want to saturate an area with explosives in a cost-effective way, since it also has a massive morale effect. Using HIMARS or M270 for this is just wasting money.",wdf6s0
"Some things first.

1. You pretend to come up with a question. / To start a discussion. But you clearly already have an opinion.
2. Please get your facts straight and don't adjust them to your opinion.

Facts:

BM-1 has a range of 30km only with new rockets. But the same is true for tube artillery, give a WW2 artillery today's ammunition and you will see wonders. 

M777 doesn't need Excalibur rounds to go for 30km, simple base-bleed does the job for some time.

Your stated prices are incorrect the base version of a single Excalibur should cost more than 70k USD. The procurement cost is higher, but this is true for all Weapon systems.

\-----

The old rule is artillery for sustaining fire like when you keep enemy forces in their trench to support your attack or stop them from attacking. Or you want to destroy enemy fortifications over time in a cheap way. WW1 style, which is still valid. 

Missiles for bursts, like you have spotted an enemy concentration in the open, you shower them with hits, without giving them time to run back into the shelter.

As you have correctly stated times are changing and above are the old rules... But the case is complicated and I wrote already too much.",wdf6s0
"You can't drop a Himars into a mountainous region with a helicopter, so no, there will always be a need for towed artillery",wdf6s0
"No, they have different uses from MLRS‚Äô. Conventional artillery has a more tactical application and MLRS focuses on strategic targets e.g. supply lines, ammunition dumps, fuel dumps etc.

Conventional Artillery is still enormously useful when you‚Äôre on the frontline you know roughly where the enemy is and you need to bring greater firepower down on that area. It also tends to be cheaper to use than GMLRS‚Äô.",wdf6s0
Tube artillery will always be an affordable option to countries on a budget and to assist expensive systems in wealthy nations,wdf6s0
Artillery has been fundamental for both sides in this war‚Ä¶ HIMARS is a strategic weapon.. artillery is tactical.. they do completely different things.,wdf6s0
"For the invader the Russian shelling makes sense. For the defender it does not, here you want precise counter-battery strikes.",wdf6s0
"Both types have its advantages and disadvantages. 

1. The range of artillery isn't solely dependent on the shell. What is firing the artillery matters. An M777 might reach 30 km with base bleed but a Polish Krab can reach 40km with base bleed. A PzH 2000 can reach greater than 40km with base bleed and more than 60km with rocket assisted. 
2. Artillery shells are easier to manufacture, which is an important factor. They can be produced faster with less parts. 
3. More shells can be carried with a ""launcher"" than rockets. A modern Paladin can carry nearly 40 rounds while  MLRS can carry 12. The Paladin's supply vehicle carries more than 90 rounds. 
4. MLRS does have  min range of 15km. I could technically shoot you in the face at 100 meters with 155 artillery. 
5. Rocket artillery is overkill for some things. 
6. Artillery is a lot cheaper to produce. Using basic shells you could fire nearly half of a Paladins stock of 155s for the cost of a single rocket. 

I don't think shell artillery will become obsolete on a worldwide scale for quite some time.  Drones, aircraft, and long range weapon systems are great for destroying enemies but they can't take and hold territory. For that you need boots on the ground. Thus for the foreseeable future mechanized ground troops will need systems like howitzers and tanks( which is just a really heavily armored version of a howitzer that shoots at a different angle).",wdf6s0
"Another stupid post, ‚ÄúAre the days of tanks over‚Äù?",wdf6s0
"In short, as others have said, no. For a simple scale analogy think of the difference between machine guns and sniper rifles.

A machine gun is not meant for precision fire. It can be used for engaging specific individuals, but their main goal is area suppression. They sweep an area to keep the enemy heads down so that your standard riflemen can advance in relative safety to directly engage the enemy.

A sniper rifle, while precise, is terrible at suppressing enemies. In the heat of combat one man won't know another man's head missing even 10ft away. The surviving enemies will be so tunnel visioned on killing the advancing infantry that the occasional man going down around them will not matter.

Scale that up and you have your answer to artillery and precision rockets.",wdf6s0
Almost every weapon has its use. A MPADS has even less range and yet it‚Äôs blowing up tanks left and right,wdf6s0

But today it's suddenly almost the opposite is true !?

So most of the time the media's being conjuring feel-good bullshit and people are buying it wholesale as the truth.

Ukraine is being abandoned at this point. Now tid bits of real facts are coming out to prepare the public and bring expectations closer to reality.

What‚Äôs with those colors on the ribbon? Seen that on some helmets as well.,xbxykl
Was it unroll that or walk through a mine field?,xbxykl
"If that's a slip and slide, I'M IN!",xbxykl
The foolish ruzzians in Mariopul are going to need more than that rag when the Ukrainian forces roll in with 200 tanks and infantry.,xbxykl
Can‚Äôt wait to see UA troops walking down that.,xbxykl

Is that for Halloween?,xbxykl
There will be stripes in their collective Orc tightly-whites soon too.,xbxykl

"Russia are really poor at propaganda aren‚Äôt they, the ribbons not going to help, trust me, but you might need it to keep warm lol",xbxykl
My feeling is that Ukraine would go for Mauriopol before year end. Liberating that city would be a worthy end of 2022.,xbxykl
That looks more like 210 meters. Far far from 2100 meters,xbxykl
Every 5 centimetres of the ribbon could represent one dead Russian soldier.,xbxykl
"That ribbon represents genocide.....one of the worst in history. What that city went through at russias hands is horrific.

FüåªCK YOU RUSSIA AND YOUR NAZI PROPAGANDA",xbxykl
Very useful for hiding all the dead civillians,xbxykl
They use civilians in Mariopul to demine land. Are they showing that on their high almighty TV network üôÑüôÑ,xbxykl

"Russians are out of their minds.
They are blatantly losing the war and all their commanders are able to think is pushing hard this early 20th centurystyle propaganda.

It is simply pathethic. They deserve the worst possible outcome for their crimes and their stupidity.",xbxykl

And then shipped in some more as they not very impressive!",xbxykl
''It was a peaceful protest'',xbxykl
"So.. 2100 meters. It's what, about 10 meters wide? 2.1 meter length x 2 meter wide (top + bottom).. Enough to make about 5000 body bags for dead Russian soldiers.

Russia needs to increase their commitment. This is barely enough for a week.",xbxykl
Money well spent,xbxykl
Are they setting Guinness world record for largest toilet paper?,xbxykl
"This isn't 2100m by any stretch of the imagination.
Probably closer to 210m",xbxykl
"Paid for by not paying russian soldiers their war ""Bonus"", this war is so sad in so many ways. What a waste of life and time/resources, russia's leadership and following citizens are really showing how  utterly useless they are.

Best of luck to ukraine hope mariupol will be free again soon.",xbxykl
That is the biggest roll of toilet paper I‚Äôve ever seen.,xbxykl

Since most of ‚Äòpro-Russia‚Äô has restricted access to just about everything except state run media, most users are pro-Ukraine.

"It's pro-Ukrainian but they do try to post unbiased posts or balanced posts to the extent Russian material allows, factoring in the strategic implications for the armed forces & any civilians involved, of Ukraine. Since Russian materials are rarely non-staged & non-doctored just right, or presented by some camera people in a place they carefully selected to show on 1st channel in Moscow, they don't make it through. However, there have been instances of footage of UA POWs, burned vehicles and defeats as well as copious images of infrastructural damage. Funerals are about on par, many posts for RuZZian generals and some more decorated and elaborate posts for Ukrainian heroes who have fallen. The hard line this sub draws is on misinformation, so this already prevents most propaganda Russia puts out - but don't expect more than 10% of posts about anything bad happening to/from Ukrainians as this is a real up-to-date strategic sub. Even skeptics and people who want to be balanced on here who agree with this statement, as is next, would like the order of operations to be primarily Z's getting their asses kicked to 1600's and secondly having united nations investigate and go through all the evidence, but after Russia's been properly restricted from fucking up in the future like so.",tvw5wo

Thought he had more sense having seen how the West fared with invasions - thought he would've known that Ukraine would be a gaping wound bleeding Russian blood and treasure even if he did manage to take it. Thought he would've known that sending  conscripts with 1980s tanks in on the basis of a lie wasn't going to go well against an army trained and equipped by the West. Perhaps he doesn't care. Perhaps he doesn't care that Russias progress socially and economically now looks as if it will all be undone. My honest opinion now is that he is 2022s Hitler - drunk on the idea of his nations military power but slowly sinking into the depths of paranoia and anger because his advisers and generals are too scared to tell him the truth.

"This is entirely not about ‚Äúbuffering NATO‚Äù. He wants to accomplish ‚ÄúRussia‚Äôs destiny‚Äù in uniting all of Europe in a backwards conservative totalitarian empire with vassal states. 

In Putin‚Äôs eyes democracy could never work, and he doesn‚Äôt care about what the West thinks, or how Ukrainians and even Russian citizens feel. As long as he is able to physically repress people so they comply, he will do so. 

More likely his intention is to impose so much torture, pain and fear that people become numb and comply out of a sense of helplessness. 

He counts on the west not taking proactive measures. After taking over Ukraine he‚Äôd bide his time suppressing revolts and supporting extremist proponents in Western countries to destabilise democracies from within. Eventually his hope would be to weaken NATO/EU countries to a point that there would be no real opposition to his further expansion.

"I have the feeling that the Russians used the KA-52 Alligatoir almost exclusively at the beginning of the war. I haven't seen any in a long time now. or only very rarely. 

According to the production numbers, there must still be some, but who knows if they were cannibalized or never existed. For a while we still saw Mi-28. But they are a bit rarer than KA 50 and 52.

 for a while the russian air force has adapted a lot to the ukrainian one. Mi-24 with unguided missiles. Su 24 and mi 29. Together with the couple SU 34 and 35 that they still dare to use.

Regarding this interview, the core of it was: ""Either Russia assimilates us in 10-12 years and we cease to exist or we try to join NATO. The price to joining NATO is a full fledged war with Russia"".

The OP is posting it like it is war mongering, but does not mention that Ukraine did not plan to attack Russia, it planned to repel the Russian attack. It's Russia who always wanted to conquer Ukraine, and was actively doing it since 2014 by annexing Crimea and starting the war in the Eastern Ukraine by creating LPR/DPR.",tw0mx7

We just grind them without getting up from our seats.""  
  
""Airborne operations are a very big firebrand. The Russians do not have enough strength and resources for this either. The grouping accumulated in the Crimea is capable of transferring 650 people at a time with a daily supply of combat operations... well, they're rubbed.defense from slingshots will shoot, even the army will not be needed.""

""Rocket attacks are terribly funny. They won't get anywhere - they're crooked-armed. In Syria, they fired five ""Calibers"" into an object measuring 3.5 km2 and did not hit.

France itself won't be sanctioned by its allies for the actions of a private company. Thales is partially state owned but that's not the same as being exclusively state controlled.

Lots of other Western countries have sold tech to the Russians. Sanctions would be getting handed out like it was Oprah if it was being done fairly.",x27ymn
"The french State participation in Thales Group is 25%, according to the text.
Difficult to considere that french state agrees the delivery of war material to Russia via Thales. Even if it is bankable.
Another hypothese : this material is sold to intermediary (another foreign company/state), and this third part sails it to Russia. With agree of French state and Thales, or not.

Hell, in the U.S., it is illegal to send a Chinese made red dot sight out of the country without ITAR compliance, so I can't imagine that the French Government didn't know they were sending weapons sensors to Russia.

This is at best speculation and the source doesn't inspire quality but in the event that they willingly sold equipments post sanctions they're in trouble. Those allegations are not new. There was a scandal with aiming equipment for Russians airforce where people found out that that they were delivering contracts signed before the sanction date,x27ymn

I mean thermite can burn directly through a engine block. So I really don‚Äôt see how either of these raining from the sky is okayed by any military. Especially on civilian related anything.,tpwk77

"That's shits been dropped from a jet at day time, not blown up on the ground at night time. I'm sure that's going to look and react differently.",tpwk77
"Military uses

Thermite hand grenades and charges are typically used by armed forces in both an anti-materiel role and in the partial destruction of equipment; the latter being common when time is not available for safer or more thorough methods.[31][32] For example, thermite can be used for the emergency destruction of cryptographic equipment when there is a danger that it might be captured by enemy troops. Because standard iron-thermite is difficult to ignite, burns with practically no flame and has a small radius of action, standard thermite is rarely used on its own as an incendiary composition. It is more usually employed with other ingredients added to enhance its incendiary effects. Thermate-TH3 is a mixture of thermite and pyrotechnic additives which have been found to be superior to standard thermite for incendiary purposes.[33] Its composition by weight is generally about 68.7% thermite, 29.0% barium nitrate, 2.0% sulfur, and 0.3% of a binder (such as PBAN).[33] The addition of barium nitrate to thermite increases its thermal effect, produces a larger flame, and significantly reduces the ignition temperature.[33] Although the primary purpose of Thermate-TH3 by the armed forces is *as an incendiary anti-material weapon,* it also has uses in welding together metal components.

*A classic military use for thermite is disabling artillery pieces*, and it has been used for this purpose since World War 2; such as at Pointe du Hoc, Normandy.[34] Thermite can permanently disable artillery pieces without the use of explosive charges, and therefore thermite can be used when silence is necessary to an operation. This can be done by inserting one or more armed thermite grenades into the breech and then quickly closing it; this welds the breech shut and makes loading the weapon impossible.[35] Alternatively, a thermite grenade discharged inside the barrel of the gun will foul the barrel, making the weapon very dangerous to fire; thermite can also be used to weld the traversing and elevation mechanism of the weapon, making it impossible to aim properly.[citation needed]

*Thermite was used in both German and Allied incendiary bombs during World War II.*[36][37] Incendiary bombs usually consisted of dozens of thin thermite-filled canisters (bomblets) ignited by a magnesium fuse. Incendiary bombs destroyed entire cities due to the raging fires that resulted from their use.[citation needed] Cities that primarily consisted of wooden buildings were especially susceptible. These incendiary bombs were utilized primarily during nighttime air raids. Bombsights could not be used at night, creating the need to use munitions that could destroy targets without the need for precision placement.

"Umm, you would see the 'octopus' smoke trails on the second picture if it were daytime. I don't see how these photos are helpful at all.",tpwk77
Good to know it.,tpwk77
"White phosphorus is said to burn a blueish green or blue tinted green, which I think I see a bit of blue in those sparks and a greenish fade around them",tpwk77

But then again who will enforce rules in the war.. It's war, there is none.",tpwk77

"And how anybody could imagine Ukraine accepted as NATO member in 2008 - extremly corrupted, full of pro-russians and agents at every level etc. And Georgia not much of a difference.

"No, Russia is solely responsible for the invasion of Ukraine. Russia is the one commiting genocide against Ukraine.

"Sorry to say, but Ukraine was NOT ready to be in NATO in 2008. As stated by others, it was a basket case with possibly half the people in the country against it.

"I have plenty of complaints about the governments of both countries, but their opposition in 2008 - right or wrong - was determined in good-faith. 

In 2008, the US was tied up in the ‚ÄúSurge‚Äù in Iraq and bogged down against geurilla fighters in Afghanistan. They were far too commited to project the overwhelming force necessary to serve as an ideal deterrent.

I take them at face-value in that they were trying to *avoid* the war we have today. It merely postponed it.

Hindsight is 20/20.  In 2008 the US and UK wanted Ukraine in and France and Germany did not.  Their reasoning then was likely valid.  They have been right when we in the US and UK have been wrong (Iraq WMDs anyone?). Nothing can be done about that.

"This can not be serious?  You hope that Ukraine befriends a force (SDF) that is in opposition to a country (Turkey) who provided the most crucial of weapons systems during the opening stages of the war.  Then you want then to befriend the other force (FSA) against the SDF but supports turkey.  

That‚Äôs a head scratcher.  Yes Ukraine should shit in the plate of thankfulness to Turkey for keeping the Bosporus closed providing TB2 at a drop of the hat. So they can do what?

"There is no ""Syrians"".  The territory of the nation state called Syria is populated by a majority of Sunni Muslim Arabs, lorded over by a small group of Alawites, whom most Sunni Muslims don't even consider to be real Muslims, and despise even more than they hate the Shiites.  Yes, there are also other minorities in Syria, but that doesn't change the fundamental picture.

The people who opposed Assad are the Sunni Muslim Arabs of Syria, plus a whole lot of Sunni Muslims who came from all over the world to join the Jihad.  They are the ones who created ISIS, which was the most effective opposition to Assad for several years, and was only eventually defeated by a combination of Russia, Syrian Alawites, Lebanese Hezbollah (Shiites), and Iran.

So your suggestion effective means that Ukraine will find common cause with a bunch of fanatical Islamic fighters.  The closest contact the Ukrainians have with such people are the Chechens fighting for Putin.  That's not going to happen.",ussd5k

"Unlikely.

A country that sends official military units, even under the guise of Foreign Legion, would likely get a declaration of war from Russia which could be dangerous (cruise missiles are dangerous regardless of how poor their military is). 

It would also be a very big problem if SepcOps units got caught, killed, or at least identified operating in Ukraine or Russia. 

Oh, and most countries are happy to give equipment to Ukraine because it isn't their own soldiers being killed or injured.",wp1253
we cannot confirm or deny the existence of Canadian special forces in Ukraine,wp1253
Units probably no but inteligence officers on higher up command posts are more than probable plus some instructors traveling with himars and such complex systems aren't unlikely. And in April there was some speculation about SAS training UA specops with western equipment.,wp1253
At the moment there‚Äôs only volunteer veterans from other countries acting on their own accord. Would still be beautiful to watch some SAS or Royal Marines go over there and mop the floor with those pathetic Russian excuses for soldiers,wp1253

"Foreigners are actively fighting in Ukraine. In fact,  footage of foreign fighters is posted in this sub regularly( though not real often). Ukraine has thousands of foreigners from dozens of countries  on the front lines plus thousands more helping in other ways further behind the lines. 

The foreign legion is kind of an open secret. Foreign fighters would be more of a target than Ukrainian soldiers since it would become a propaganda opportunity for Russia. They are not talked about as much as Ukrainians soldiers for that reason among others.",wp1253
"No, not a single one. Foreign fighters, sure. Foreign units, no way. How could that possibly be kept secret and who would be stupid enough to risk it? Kind of a silly question.",wp1253

"IMHO The West is using every available chance to absorb the lessons of the war via embedding intelligence guys, ops guys and other specialists throughout the war zone.

You think President Zelensky is happy this is happening?

I get the emotional point of view ‚ÄúRussians are the bad guys, they killed civilians, their invaders, they deserve this‚Äù. But you need to think logically here.

Torturing POWs will make Russians less likely to surrender, it will harden the resolve of Russians everywhere, and it will scare away the western countries that support Ukraine.

"I‚Äôm pro Ukraine through and through, and maybe it‚Äôs easy for me to say this as I‚Äôm lucky enough to live on the other side of the planet. 

But this can‚Äôt be allowed to happen. Not only is a breach of the Geneva conventions but we want Russians to surrender. Doing this just encourages them to fight harder. If we show how well they can be treated in captivity they‚Äôre a lot more likely to surrender. In addition showing humanity to prisoners wins friends and sympathy which can help drive up support around the world. By doing this that could dry up.

Not only that but it‚Äôs the right thing to do. 

Go ahead downvote me.

EDIT: forgot to add another reason for treating prisoners humanely. Russia has ukrainian pow‚Äôs as well and by broadcasting this, they could very well be at risk of danger as well. In addition it may put Ukrainian civilians in harms way, beyond the current indiscriminate bombing campaigns. We could see situations of entire villages executed by angry Russians.

I‚Äôm not saying the Russians ‚Äòdeserve‚Äô to be treated humanely, as many have shown they are nothing but monsters, but my above points still stand. A lot of these guys are basically still kids or conscripts. It‚Äôs also easy to say ‚Äòwhy didn‚Äôt you just refuse orders, flee, etc‚Äù but it‚Äôs hard to figure out who you can trust in your platoon or division with things like plans to surrender, for if your higher ups find out.

"[Something I wrote about in another thread ](https://www.reddit.com/r/UkrainianConflict/comments/tcjmpk/-/i0dt7cg)

>Something that can be hard to wrap our heads around is, treating these soldiers nicely after they surrender sends a signal to other Russians that it's ok to surrender. The rougher Ukranians treat Russians, the less likely other troops will be to surrender which is exactly what Putin wants -- sort of a baked in [Stalin era order 227.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Order_No._227?wprov=sfla1) it's outsourcing the regulation of morale and compliance of his troops to the Ukrainians' in a sort of proxy way if they don't act kindly to troops that surrender. If there is harsh repercussions if you surrender/retreat, you are less likely to do either. If surrendering/retreating seems painless, why wouldn't you? Especially if you're not entirely sure why you're there. Putin would LOVE for the world to hate Russians right now. That would give them so much purpose and galvanize them together. Ultimately it is Putins fault and his regime that put his military in the position it is today.

>This is also a similar tactic that the Mormon church employs. The higher ups know that people are going to most likely be rude to them when they get woken on a weekend morning which can then be pointed at to probe how rude and mean the outside world is which keeps them in the Mormon faith. Same deal, just with war instead. Treat the surrendered soldiers nicely and more of them will surrender. If the goal is to stop the war and have as many Russians surrender as possible, it makes sense to use a strategy that actually makes more soldiers surrender, not just be a badass, even if they deserve mistreatment. 

>The goal is to end the war, not be a badass. No one should bring their ego into this. That's what Putin is doing -- bringing his ego into the situation. It's bigger than any one person's ego so we have to think wider than just what they deserve. Giving them what they deserve doesn't take into account that people don't always act rationally even if we are justified. That is the problem here -- if they did, we wouldn't be in the situation to begin with so we need to think about things in a different framework that is as devoid of ego as we can get. Ego is how we got here in the first place and more in an effort to counter it will just feed the machine.

They just made their resilince of the Russians even more resilient. Regardless if they were justified, filming this only galvanizes the Russians and gives them something to point to. They just killed more Ukrainians' by doing this because maybe some of the Russians that would have surrendered out of shame are now going to fight harder out of anger. Why would they surrender now when they know this is what is going to happen to them? I'd rather have a Russian surrender to me rather than one fighting me if I had to choose.",tpl025
"It appears they're torturing POWs???  No cool, dudes",tpl025
"For someone who attempted to take your life moments before, it looks like they are being very well treated",tpl025
"If this is ukranians its horrific and those doing the shooting need to be prosecuted. However it might be ukranian POWs dressed as Russians and Russian's dressed as ukranians, it's a pr coup for the Russians.",tpl025

"I recently read a summary (Blinkest) 

https://www.blinkist.com/en/books/command-and-control-en

of the book

https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Command_and_Control_(book)

And i was horrified! 13 'Broken Arrow' events for the USA alone between 1960 and 1990. I.e. mistakenly fired or partially detonated nuclear weapons. 

So god knows what Russia has already done and would do if they tried to launch....",v0684c
"The USA spends at least $60 billion a year maintaining its nuclear arsenal. That's Russias entire military yearly budget. So, seeing as nuclear upkeep is so damn expensive (Uranium has a shelf-life of about 10 years before it starts to degrade), Putins cry to ready the countries nuclear arsenal could all just be a bluff to prevent NATO from putting boots on the ground in the Ukraine. Russia knows it can't win a conventional war with NATO so the threat of using nuclear ordnance is leverage to gain militarily in the Ukraine. It wouldn't surprise me one bit if most of Russias nuclear arsenal is either redundant or, just not fit for purpose.",v0684c
My hopes are that their nukes kinda switch course midway and blow up Moscow.,v0684c
"What is ""a *conventional* nuclear weapon""?",v0684c
I wonder how the west will respond and how the rest of the world,v0684c
"Well statistic say 40% for it to explode on start or not launch and if it flies 60% chance to actually detonate, wasn't it?",v0684c
"Modern nuclear weapons are extraordinarily complex and posessed of a number of exotic failure modes. They require regular maintenance, inspection and replacement of parts. The greatest challenge is the tolerances on parts. Misalignment, a slight change in material properties due to aging or exposure, and you won't even get a nuclear fizzle. You'll just get a low order HE detonation that spreads a cloud of very expensive vaporised metal and the stink of shame.",v0684c
"probably 50% fail.  

who cares?  nukes are literally as relevent as a giant asteroid.  if it happens, hug your loved ones and thats it.  Zero sense worrying about it.",v0684c
Even if only 5% work that's still a grim number.,v0684c
"I'll say it now and I'll say it again, with how much corruption there is in the Russian military, imagine the amount centered around a weapon that is never tested and never used.",v0684c
"Meh, bitch boy putin ain't got the balls to launch. Hell, he doesn't even dare to call it a war.",v0684c
"Are Russian guns not working?  Their tanks?  Is that actually the problem Ukraine is facing?  

Are it‚Äôs planes not working?  Or is Ukraine shooting them down at alarming rates?  

Those planes, including strategic bombers that are not being used in Ukraine (or at least infrequently), still patrol the borders of Russia.  Those bombers can carry nuclear bombs and nuclear tipped cruise missiles launched hundreds or thousands of miles away from their targets. 

Russian subs have launched Kaliber cruise missiles with conventional warheads.  Have they failed in mass?  What happened if they arms them with nuclear warheads?  

Their strategic ballistic missiles are solid fueled, easy to maintain, and can hit anywhere in the world within 30 minutes. 

For some reason, we get one dumb post after another that mistakes Russia‚Äôs baffling issues with combined arms warfare and incoherent strategy with equipment that does not work.  Russian tanks clearly work and NATO tanks advancing into swarms of ATGM‚Äôs would face no different results if similarly misemployed.  Mariupol and recent advances in the East make it clear that, properly coordinated, the Russians are capable of making advances as they unscrew themselves. 

To get from there to ‚Ä¶ Russia‚Äôs nukes must be broken ‚Ä¶ no need to analyze the actual weapons ‚Ä¶ I just know stuff about them! 

The command that watches Russia‚Äôs nukes is called STRATCOM, and is headed by a 4-star admiral.  If you have not analyzed Russia‚Äôs nukes and are instead relying on nascent Junior Rommel wizardry, [try looking at some real analysis.](https://sgp.fas.org/crs/nuke/R45861.pdf)

Not only does source lay out what Russia‚Äôs forces look like and how America‚Äôs forces need to counter them, it makes clear what every expert on Russia‚Äôs nukes makes clear: only an idiot would believe all, or even a significant number of, Russia‚Äôs 5500 nukes are either in poor condition or would not work. 

Russia has invested heavily in its nuclear forces precisely because of scenarios like Ukraine.  Absent nukes, is there any reason NATO a would not be attacking a weakened Russia?",v0684c
I think putin and Kim Jong Un would have personal competitions on who can make their missiles worse,v0684c
"Somebody relevant recently posted a bit of intel that about 30% of the MRBM Iksander rockets hit anywhere near their targets...  Nukes by nature,, don't have to be accurate to fulfil their role.  They are largely political weapons.",v0684c
They probably haven't been maintained so the second they try they will ALL DIE. LMAO,v0684c
It will fly towards its target. Nuclear missiles aren't conscripted.,v0684c
I think the issue is out of 6000 potential nuclear missiles even a 1% success rate is a failure for human life on earth.,v0684c
Wishfulthinking that russia can launch any of them,v0684c

"This is a hard sell. No defensive action can be performed without attacking something with a war plane. This is to be highly avoided, as retaliation on a much larger scale is possible. At the moment not a lot could even be done with planes, as they are short and medium range Russian AA defences stationed in Ukraine, and long range AA ready in Belarus and Russia.

I feel the desperation behind this post, but really, a hard sell IMO.",tikthh
"Also a No for me.

There is more that Biden can do like directly support the foreign legion like the US did with China and the UK. Directly putting any NATO country against the Russians has too high a risk of escalation. You think it's bad now? What will a tactical suitcase nuke look like? I didn't think Putin was crazy enough to start the war, now I'm not going to pretend to know how far he will go.

You also don't understand the things Trump wanted to do but was talked out of it. Trump is more crazy than Putin.

As for the 200 soldiers killed and wounded in Syria, they were Russian mercenaries and they were going to attack an American position.

This is Sarah Ashton-Cirillo. Prior to all this she was in Las Vegas and Florida (and still comments on Vegas politics from time to time). Nobody seemed upset by this sort of practice until the transgender reporter did it, and she doesn't seem to be on tik-tok, that's just trolling.

She's been in Kharkiv for most of the war even as that city has been bombed more days than not. She was in Bhakmut last week as the Wagner Nazi Russians pushed hard to take the town.

The not the greatest reporter - a bit less objective than many and much of her reporting is just relaying what she's seeing around her. But she's one of the most consistently in the thick of it English-speaking reporters.

And much like Malcom Nance, she can't help but become part of the story. Russia and its willing idiots continually push the line that Ukraine is Nazi, run by Nazis, supportive of Nazis. So Ashton-Cirillo's and Nance's experiences stand in contrast to that, as they are accepted by the local populations. Real Nazis, after all, would kill either one of them for being who they are, along with Ukraine's Jewish president.

But they don't because Ukraine is not Nazi, Ashton-Cirillo's life on the scene and everyday work proves that.",y0abfl

Sarah is not identifying the person, in any way, she's reporting a war crime, and with genuine distress at having to do this.

Before I give up on all the dickheads saying that this is disrespectful and that this is done for tiktok or some shit,  She's actually far braver than most people on this thread.

[Meet the trans war correspondent at Ukraine‚Äôs frontlines](https://xtramagazine.com/power/trans-war-correspondent-sarah-ashton-cirillo-ukraine-227220)

People are becoming so indoctrinated by doom scrolling filtered lifestyles on social media that they instantly think that a video is only done for the likes.

She's showing reality, unfiltered.  And is in the thick of it (she spent most of her time there in Kherson, and it seems only travelled to Kyiv to report on this horrific shit, it's why she quickly corrects the place she's at).

I don't know Sarah, but I wanted to find out more about her after all the comments saying that this is 'disgusting' and only for likes, when what I could see and hear in her reporting was genuine distress.

Btw, reporters usually have their face in the things they're reporting first hand, but the camera is usually held by someone else, so I understand your confusion between reporting news and those funny influencer vids where they hold the camera themselves.  Damn, she should've used a selfie stick and a gimbal to make it more professional, I guess that wasn't on her mind at the time",y0abfl

"It dosent seem to relative at the moment. What is relative is the command structure and the hours of quality training these guys have received, and with who else. The Ukrainian army, airforce and navy have trained with US and NATO forces for years, are skilled in fighting while synchronising other branches to attack or defend from multiple angles. The Russians apparently had less than half that training, can't really synchronise attacks, and lack the expertise of not training with other strong nations. Also russian pilots are refusing to fly, whereas the Ukrainian pilots who are flying the exact same planes are taking more risks and the Russians just can't match it. The Russian command structure has the comanders riding with the crews, wheras americans have there commands behind the front lines looking at the big picture. The Ukrainian and foreign snipers have now killed more Russian generals that any other war Russia has had since WW2.",tncyph
"From this [article](https://www.cbc.ca/news/world/ukraine-russia-military-comparison-1.6365115) Russia has 900k active duty personnel. Currently around 150k are stationed in Ukraine (about 15%).

Note: Russia is also possibly suffering from ""ghost soldiers""

Ukraine military is about 200k strong, however they have mobilized all reservists bringing that number to 1M. Along with civilians assisting any way they can (logistics/light arms) Russia will have a nearly impossible task of taking large portions of Ukrainian territory.

If annexing all of Ukraine were the goal, I don't think the entire active personnel of Russia could due to fighting 1M+ troops which out number them slightly. They also have to fight into a defensive position which is atleast 2:1 casualties. They would need to bring in reservists which is not a popular option in Russia and that still would be a close fight. I also think Russia hasn't committed its full force because of NATO posturing.

If taking the Kyiv is the goal, I think Russia would need to dedicate atleast 500k troops to take it (probably through seige).

I think the whole purpose of this war is to install a puppet government to add a buffer for NATO and western culture and to have another Belarusian esk ally.

Thats just my 2 cents",tncyph
"At this point it‚Äôs about 75% of their effective combat power. The number you‚Äôre referring to is just their reserve manpower, but those people have basically no training, aren‚Äôt equipped, and are just working normal civilian jobs. Almost all of Russia‚Äôs trained troops have already been committed to the conflict. That‚Äôs why they‚Äôre finding it so hard to get reinforcements into the theater, sure they could mobilize the reserves but that‚Äôll take months and they won‚Äôt exactly be able to keep refusing to call it a war if they‚Äôre sending more than a million men into theater. And given how poorly they‚Äôve supplied the 200k they‚Äôve brought in so far I don‚Äôt think they‚Äôre even capable of launching an attack with that many men, even if they were trained and equipped.",tncyph
"200k+ Russian troops were reported on Ukraine‚Äòs borders prior to invasion.  I don‚Äôt know what percentage have since entered Ukraine, but it is a high number (80-90%, maybe more, if you haven‚Äôt been watching).   Reinforcements from out of theatre have since engaged.  IMO 200k+ Russian troops, probably in excess of 250k, have been sent into Ukraine",tncyph
"Small, but other forces are tied op on other duties, Armenia. Occupied Georgia, Syria, National borders, and China border, just taken over from french in Sahara, also UN commitments.",tncyph
"We will never really know what accurate russian number would look like.  But they sent their best men and equipment and got bent in the process.  There are other units but they are probably undertrained, understaffed, or have less than functional equipment.  Those are the very reasons they weren't included.  They probably have tons of people they could call up into units and slowly supply with second class gear but what kind of reinforcement is that when your best just got suppressed.  

I find it the most interesting that they sent their most capable units in with bad intel, disjointed leadership, and communications equipment their enemy can crack into effortlessly?  Its analogous to the US special forces performance in Grenada, Ill considered and thus pathetic.",tncyph
The post itself and the answers are reminiscent of those from the first few days of the war as though people haven't been reading thousands of reddit posts that have elaborated and far expanded on this topic,tncyph
"Active duty- 1 million
With reserves- 3 million
Ukraine invasion force- 150,000?",tncyph
It may be correct as it seems the only Russian troops there are conscripts.,tncyph
So they've lost 10% of 10%...1% gotta feed the meet grinder,tncyph

Lot of the pics are conscripts from the separatist areas of the Donbas and there are some reports of criminals being taken from prison and put into the fight. So not the cream of the crop in personnel,tvqn3a
"I think there is enough evidence to suggest the Russian system is largely at fault. The victories over the Nazis are still celebrated like it was yesterday. The regime has weaponized that mindset by labeling Ukraine and the west in general as the new Nazis.

Beyond that, we know that a large amount of troops sent into the conflict zone by the Russian military are from the provinces and far reaches of Siberia. A lesson they learnt in previous conflicts was to avoid large scale casualties from large urban areas like Moscow and St Petersburg because it was harder to hide the losses.

Un-educated certainly but the low moral compass, animalistic behavior comes from somewhere deep within the Russian psyche IMO.",tvqn3a
"Armchair theory, based on no evidence whatsoever: In some parts of Russia, there is a Mongolian influence to the population.  (Russia is *huge*, going from Europe to Asia)

This causes a slight asian shape to the eyes.  In the West, we have a cultural stereotype where we associate asian eye shape on a white person with Down's Syndrome.

In fact, Down's Syndrome used to be called 'Mongolism' or 'Mongolian Idiocy'

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Down_syndrome#Name

"Most of them look like what the Americans might call white trash. It is a country that killed off its intelligencia, pushed out whole populations, is corrupt to the core and suffers from the debilitating addiction to alcohol. There is very little regard for human life, for education, for rights. I know many Russians and I can safely say that Stalin really did a number on them. Putin is continuing in the direction of destroying anything that might be beneficial for his own people. It is no wonder that the educated are leaving the country in droves.

"Malnutrition coupled with alcoholism is endemic in Russia. The infamous brutal dehumanizing of young Russian Army conscripts via hazing is known the world over.

"Well, Russia is the number one producer of consensual incest porn in the world, with several family porn production companies. Like many countries in Asia and Eastern Europe consensual incest is legal for persons over 18. I have mentioned before that western cultural taboos, for example incest and cannibalism, did not exist in Asia until the last two or three centuries.

Countries with high poverty and high alcoholism are also likely to have high rates of both consensual and non-consensual incest. Outside of Moscow and St. Petersburg most Russians are poor and alcoholism is high.",tvqn3a

"Take a look at most service men in most countries, most of em look like that. 

It's no secret that for the most part being good looking gets you farther in life. It starts in school, being ugly in school gets you picked on, a parent or teacher may even pick on kid if they're ugly, that treatment leaves them marginalized  and neglected leading to depression and poor performance in school. If an ugly person and a good looking person both went for an interview, and had the same upbringing, qualifications, intellect, personality, connections and drive who do you think would get the job? I'd say 7 out of 10 times the good looking person would, even though the ugly person probably faced more hurdles to get to the same point in the heir whole being.",tvqn3a
"It sounds horrible to say, but in a lot of countries, men join the army because they have nothing else going for them. No skills, no prospects - vulnerable men are gobbled up by military recruiters in the same way they are by street gangs. I‚Äôm not sure if it‚Äôs still the case, but in Vietnam, the USA sent people to the front line who would classify as mentally retarded. And they got shot to pieces when they arrived. 

Russia‚Äôs education system is completely broken due to years of cuts. It previously had a technical programme where you could do an apprenticeship if you weren‚Äôt academically oriented (a great approach in theory), but its youth are languishing in a spiral of public services deprivation so the military is usually the best bet for them.",tvqn3a

"Russia is less a unified nation and more an amalgamation of ethnic/cultural groups and semi-autonomous regions, dominated by the russian heartland. Outside of the biggest cities, Russia is largely underdeveloped and has massive issues with drug abuse, poverty and HIV. It's from these remote, forgotten areas that the conscripts for this campaign were drawn. Because their deaths don't matter.",tvqn3a
I‚Äôve been downvoted to hell for making the same observation.,tvqn3a
"I agree with what seems to be the consensus. It's a combination of factors - higher incest rates than Western Europe, poverty and all the ills that come with it, generation upon generation living in a system of oppression - but it's the rates of alcoholism and fetal alcohol syndrome that stand out from that of any other country in the world.

""According to published data, the prevalence of FASD in children from Russian orphanages is estimated to be¬†between 30% and 66%. A total of 90% of Russian women at fertile age consume alcohol and up to 20% continue to consume it during pregnancy.Feb 3, 2021.""

I could go into their complete lack of social services programs, which necessitates unregulated orphanages and results in human trafficking being a hobby instead of a crime. (This chaps my ass to no end.) I'll maintain my focus on the numbers in this one section of the complete NBCI report.
 https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7913360/#:~:text=According%20to%20published%20data%2C%20the,to%20consume%20it%20during%20pregnancy.

He treats you like shit, makes sure you are armed, fed and treated like shit, so you must be be shit. Must Ukraine prove how putin is treating you? Nothing will change as long as putin keeps giving your country these crazy orders. Putin, his family and whomever he trusts tomorrow will be OK. Until you all realize he has lost his mind and ability for rational thought, the very people he ask to sacrifice themselves for his country, himself and his friends, will be the ones who pay the price to accomplish his goals, even as they change daily.

"""provoked"" 

Come on. Russia has bordered multiple NATO countries for decades. NATO only exists to block Putin from taking what he wants and leaving a wake of ash and mass graves in his wake. 

But the reason - land, resources, control over European resources like grain and oil. To bring former Soviet states back into a federation.

"Putin hoped no one would be looking at how completely Russia pooped the bed with their Covid vaccine failures. And to his credit no one is talking about that.

"Goddammit. I've said this so many times. I'm not an apologist for Putin, but the West has antagonised him. Nuclear war wise, it's him vs Biden. The younger people on this forum really don't understand the drama  of some mad fuck pressing the button that we lived through. Putin keeps threatening it.",vjcylv
"I'm from Britain, and as a nation we remember how the rest of the world left us to deal with the Nazi regime ourselves between  June 1940 and December 1941, when Americans didn't want to know about war (neither did we, which was why Chamberlain was hailed as a saviour, but we also got dragged in). And while London was being blitzed, the Nazis and Soviets were enjoying a love in, carving up Poland between them.  I really don't think that most people realise how close to collapse democracy was back then. So, as a descendant of those people, I'd like to say that the Russian vs Ukraine war isn't really an argument about democracy vs state, and not nearly as close cut as the media would have you believe. These people declared UDI without thinking that there might be a cunt like Putin chasing after them about the borders they'd declared.",vjcylv

Tank is not dead but without air support it‚Äôs inefficient,wzawix
"Losing tanks in high intensity combat is nothing new. Humans have short memories. There were times the British lost 200 tanks in a single day in a single battle in ww2. I‚Äôm sure the Russians had worse days in
Ww2. All this without ATGMs. It‚Äôs far more important to remember offense operations are extremely hard. An army has to be properly trained, led, and supported. That when you don‚Äôt execute combined arms doctrine with well coordinated attacks with artillery and air you will suffer a lot of casualties.",wzawix
"I mean, the Marine Corps did away with them",wzawix
"most of the tanks are nowhere near frontline or in range... also have you seen the loses on Oryx? That's pretty insane by any standard, tank is as good as useless... of course unless you dont give a fuck about your own people",wzawix
"Tanks are an obsolete 20th century weapon. When a skilled infantry man with a $200,000 ATGM can easily destroy a $ 4.5 million dollar tank with over 90% certainty it becomes a numbers game. 
Skilled infantry with advanced weapons is the 21st century battlefield gamechanger now.",wzawix
"Nah the tank isn't dead, but this conflict certainly highlights how tanks are going to need to evolve again. Already countries are looking at speed and survivability over armor, as the javelin is a OHK militaries are taking that into consideration with the next gen of MBT. I'd say the tank as we knew it is dead, though militaries will use it's predecessors. The king is dead, long live the king.",wzawix
"Sure, the tank as a concept is not dead.

That said however, the Russian concept of the tank is getting a lot of them dead.",wzawix
"The tank most certainly is dead.

It's got to the point where a single infantry soldier can destroy a tank in a single hit at range with a portable, disposable weapon.

Tanks have been reduced to a policing role in occupied territories where the main threat is already gone.

The close range of missiles such as the javelin mean that any developed anti missile tech would have to be way in advance of what currently exists.
It would take too long to get to that point and all the while, portable anti tank weapons would be developing.",wzawix
">New anti missile defence systems may be developed in the future.

That future was 45 years ago and is called [Active protection system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Active_protection_system). One of the first was the Soviet [Drozd](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drozd). All modern western tanks have one installed (Israel's [Trophy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trophy_(countermeasure)) is used on the Abrams M1 and the Leopard 2, for instance).",wzawix
Soviet tank doctrine is dead. But the tank lives on with smart Armies of the world.,wzawix
with ICBM's we are all dead.,wzawix
I love dead Russians in tank should be the headline,wzawix
"The tanks are not dead, but they are definitly not so accurante as before. The tank still has the advantage as speed, mobility, advanced sensors and more. But they are extremly expensive both in investmentet and maintance.
In a system with air-supority, infantry  artillery, engineres and other support they are very accurante.

But ATM has longer range than the tanks Canon. Thats the same reason battleship went obsolete during and after WW2.

I think therefore many country will look for other solutions insteed of traditional tanks. Maybe smeller, ligther, cheaper solutions? Time will show",wzawix
"""ruzzia still continues to rely on its tanks....""

Occam called and he said they are dumb",wzawix
"Depends on what you call a tank!
A mobile gun mounted on a tracked vehicle with people in it could well be obsolete!",wzawix
"Russian tanks operate very effectively if you don't count the lack of infantry or close air support, no battlefield tactics to speak of, no working reactive armor, or spare parts, or trained operators, or modern targeting systems. But other than those minor flaws, they're doing very ok!",wzawix
"How many tanks are left? So far Russia almost lost 50% of its operational tanks from the entire Russian Federation., theoretically the number of operational tanks could increase. 

The front comes to a standstill and then artillery pieces get amassed at the frontline as they arrive and artillery stupidly shell the area where Russia wants to advance. Next phase Ukainian counter-battery and targeting artillery supply depots with long-range rockets, HIMARS. All this is challenging because Russia has a lot Artillery. What could further help here is use of counter-battery drones on close-rear, Helicopters, small air support. Ideally one attacks the supply routes.   


Right now Russia does not have the tanks to go on a massive offensive and tanks don' survive long enough. Tanks are not designed for sitting duck but fast movements.",wzawix
Tanks are no good without infantry support.,wzawix
"If the tank is not dead, it's breathing its last gasps of air.
After this war, militaries of the world will re-evaluate the priorities between armor and drone/himars systems. 
Drones are the new kings of battle, and high-accuracy ground-ground missiles are the queens.",wzawix
"The modern battlefield is changing. 

The tank's role and usable tactics must adapt as well. The way Russia uses tanks and, let's say the U.S. are FAR different. Plans for utilizing tanks from a U.S. perspective starts with control of the skies. Russia, for whatever reason, was never able to achieve air superiority. Even to this day, Russia does not own the air. Once air supremacy has been achieved, you can press on with joint-coordinated ground movements.    

So Russia invades, lacks necessary logistical support for army/armor, can't control the air space, then proceeds to park its miles-long columns of  armor on the side of the road waiting for things to get sorted out. 

I couldn't believe it. A couple squadrons of Apache helicopters and A-10s would have turned that into swiss cheese in no time.  Their tanks can't venture very far off-road till they get bogged down in the rich Ukrainian farm soil. LOL Nazi Germany learned those lessons all the way back in WWII getting their asses kicked and trying to retreat through quagmires of mud that made swift movements all but impossible. 

And now, poor Russian tactics, communication, command and control, and their inability to marshal a meaningful amount of armor with experienced crewmembers is starting to make this look more like a modern iteration of WW1 relying on artillery and trench warfare.   

Ukraine also suffers from not being able to field a significant amount of experienced and supported tank crews to launch anything that looks like a counter-offensive to throw the Russians back. Things have devolved to an artillery slugfest hell. 

It will be infesting for assessments to come out and show how many Russian tanks were lost to direct fire, indirect fire, ATGM, drones dropping munitions, lack of fuel, lack of maintenance, stuck and then abandoned, and just abandoned. 

Anyone with tanks in their arsenal better be sitting down and reviewing their hardware and tactics for conflicts to come. Tank development is always seeking to one-up defensive capabilities and offensive capabilities. 

I think we'll see a lot more development in the sphere of AI, unmanned drones, and the like in future conflicts. There are fewer and fewer ""safe-spaces"" on the modern day battlefield.",wzawix
Not the way the Russians are using them. Tanks supposed to be used to support there infantry. I just see Russians tank working bye there selfs very easy targets,wzawix
who said it was dead? also helis. not dead too.,wzawix

"Hello

Hello

Do you know Ilya?

Yes.

How?

He's my son.

I have bad news for you, he's no longer alive.

How?

He got lost and got killed in the woods in Ukraine.

Who am I speaking to?

You're speaking to the guy who's friends killed him... he was on our land and got killed.

Glory to Ukraine.

There was a bit of cursing involved from the guy... half of Slavic language is curse words...",toxr3g
"Translation:  
\- Yeah. Good evening.  
\- Good evening.  
\- I apologise, but do you know Ilya?   
\- Well, of course.   
\- What relation does he have to you, if it's not a secret?  
\- He's my son.  
\- Son, yeah? Well, it's a shame, but Ilyusha is no more.  
\- How?  
\- We've fucking killed him. Got lost in my homeland, in my Ukraine, and we've fucking killed him here.   
\- I see. Who am I talking to?   
\- You are talking to a man, whose friends killed him \[Ilya\].   
\- I see...  
\- Glory to Ukraine! Ilyusha died in our country, bitch, he was sent by other's will to a foreign country, and we've killed this faggot \[Ilya\] here. Accept your son now, blyat.",toxr3g
The guy sounds like a psychopath and before anyone accuses me of being Russian troll check out my post history. She‚Äôs his mother ffs.,toxr3g
"He told her that his friends killed her son. Then he used a lot of cursed words. I am polish, not ukrainian, but as far as i understand, he called her son a ""fucking faggot""",toxr3g
"I'm with Ukraine all the way but this is completely uncivilised and serves no purpose for the cause.

I understand the soldiers are angry and want to vent their anger on Russians, but calling Russian civilians and insulting them DOESN'T FUCKING HELP. Instead of blaming Putin, they will be blaming these rude Ukrainians. They only fuel Putin's support.

Shameful.",toxr3g
Ffs man show some compassion; it's his mother.,toxr3g
I feel like this sub doesn't have much respect for human life and have perhaps play a bit too much call of duty. That's someone's child.,toxr3g
this is very not cool cursing at the dead guy while informing his mom that they killed him,toxr3g
"This is not the way.  For all we know, her son was drafted and forced to fight.  He paid with his life.

Mocking his mother doesn‚Äôt win the war, it just makes you look like assholes.

I 100% support the Ukrainians, and I understand their anger.  But that woman is not Putin.",toxr3g
I get Russia invaded etc‚Ä¶but this is some pretty evil shit to call the mother of a son you kill then cuss her out rubbing her face in something her son could‚Äôve been conscripted for. Fuck this guy.,toxr3g
"Perhaps call the family; tell them their son died, and ask them to confirm it with the Russian Army.

Let the Russian people take down the regime.",toxr3g
Clearly fake. Cartoons can't have babies. Or Orcs.,toxr3g
And this is how you lose the support of the world.,toxr3g
They should call and do the opposite. Tell them the awful news with respect. Tell them they didn‚Äôt have a choice and they didn‚Äôt surrender. Tell them to please protest the war to save other mothers this same call.,toxr3g
"Im 51.  I have two 27 month olds.

My heart breaks for these kids parents.  Their children murdered by Putin.

I‚Äôm in Lviv tonight.  I volunteered to be here.

But, honest, my heart breaks for their parents.  Their beloved and treasured sons, murdered by Putin.",toxr3g
Really sick thing to do.,toxr3g
Wrong. The man died. Treat his family with respect. You will get more sympathy for your cause if you behave like a human and not a lizard.,toxr3g
"I mean maybe call his mom and tell him hes been killed, youre sorry it had to be this way, he was lead here as cannon fodder and that his russian comrades refuse to accept his remains. Then I would say that so he does not die in vain TELL his story and let everyone you know understand whats really happening here so no more have to die. Slava ukrini. 

Thats what I was expecting. This shit is just going to be turned into russian state tv propaganda.",toxr3g
"Who here supports calling the family of a deceased and saying this crap? With those words will you get the family to hate Ukrainians more or to hate Putin? Those soldiers are just doing their job, many don‚Äôt support the invasion either, not all of them are evil. Have some respect. This isn‚Äôt right at all and I can‚Äôt imagine how the family would feel. It‚Äôs different calling families of alive POW‚Äôs but this is sick.",toxr3g
Ok I fully support Ukraine It is sick what if it is  reversed ‚Ä¶‚Ä¶all dead and all loss of life should be tested with dignity ‚Ä¶.regardless,toxr3g
It is not his job to inform loved ones they have lost a Son/husband/boy friend. His job was to hand the phone to Military Intelligence so they can make better use of it. Hope he is caught and reprimanded. The intelligence military could have gained is now lost.,toxr3g
"This started well, but went horribly wrong.

He was an enemy combatant, but he was still this woman's son.

Respectfully telling her that he was killed in action would've been a kindness‚Äîit might have been months before Russia would let her know. Instead, they poisoned an entire family against Ukraine forever. üòî



Be a man, not a beast. üá∫üá¶",toxr3g
What a tw@t thing to do,toxr3g
That is sad.,toxr3g
"Second video I've seen like this.  Pointless.  Let's not forget our humanity, let's not be dragged down to this level of inane savagery.  Keep the dignity of Ukraine.",toxr3g
I hope this is fake but if it isn‚Äôt. You don‚Äôt do that to someone‚Äôs parents. You don‚Äôt do that to another soldier or their parents even when it‚Äôs the enemy.,toxr3g
"This is either a cruel action by a very crispy (burnt out/over stressed) angry soldier with serious displaced anger issues or Russian propaganda. 

If A. they need to knock it the fuck off or lose the narrative of ""the good guys"".",toxr3g
This is unnecessary and cruel.,toxr3g
Stuff like this is praised. Regardless of principles this is pretty disgusting. All over imaginary lines.,toxr3g
What a scumbag,toxr3g
He could have just said he died in battle and where could she get back his body and posessions and tell her where his body would be if they could not return it that's all. This guy is such a dick.,toxr3g
[deleted],toxr3g
just leave phones to someone can talk respectfully with these people.,toxr3g
"Adding insult to injury is not a good look, but in comparison to shelling civilians, children's hospitals and maternity hospitals, this is mild. War brings out the best and worst of people and it's human nature to want revenge and to want the Russians to feel the loss of their loved ones as they have felt in their own country. 

The only thing is it does seem cruel to taunt a mother on the death of their child, I understand why he would, but don't agree with it. Not to mention the Russian propaganda machine will spin this to their citizens which will make the Russian citizens dig in more to their propaganda and belief in the ""world vs Russia"" narrative.",toxr3g
"This is what war reduces us too‚Ä¶ I‚Äôm not defending Russian aggression or the invasion of Ukraine and I personally think all of the Russian soldiers should either revolt or surrender‚Ä¶ 

But this is disgusting behaviour. If anyone can stop this war it‚Äôs the Russian people but if they see shit like this they‚Äôll use it as fuel for further aggression against Ukraine. I know compassion for the enemy can be next to impossible to muster but to call some dead soldiers family on his cellphone and tell them we killed your son and then laugh at the family‚Ä¶ that‚Äôs dark and twisted.",toxr3g
Not like this.  Stand for something higher and be noble.  You demean yourself speaking to the mother like that and will be thought of in the same way people already think of the Russians.,toxr3g
That‚Äôs becoming more and more like one macabre and bloody big brother.,toxr3g
You understand these are conscripted young men who are forced to march on another nation correct? Is there not room for mercy for the millions of Russian lives that are also ruined because of this unjust war,toxr3g
"Fucking Ukrainians are barbaric....and getting worse ffs
These men they're killing are no different from them...just normal guys who are fighting a war for assholes
That guy was prob just a conscript who really didn't want to be there

Ukrainians soldiers are turning into savages",toxr3g
"Not ok tbh, I understand the anger, but this has a very strong smell of ‚Äúbecoming what you‚Äôre fighting against‚Äù.",toxr3g
"Yo.

I‚Äôm 51.

I‚Äôm in Ukraine.

I have fraternal twins, aged 27 months.

My heart bleeds and hurts so badly for the Russian parents.  

Untrained, I‚Äôll-equipped conscripts who were dropped off in Ukraine.  No supply.  No ‚Äúmodern‚Äù equipment.

Holy hell, I cannot relate to the horror their parents are facing.

All because of #PutinsWarCrimes #PutinsCrimesAgainstHumanity #PutinsGenocide.

F@@@ Putin.  De Oppresso Liber!  Slava Ukraini!

I will say, I wish the phone call was more polite.  Their son didn‚Äôt have a choice other than being #MurderedByPutin.",toxr3g
This might as well be Russian propaganda. It‚Äôs damaging to Ukraine and if you‚Äôre supporting or reposting this you might as well collect some rubles for your trouble.,toxr3g
I see no ‚ÄúUkrainian hero‚Äù here. Just a coward piece of shit who is insulting the mother of a dead man for his own satisfaction. Disgusting bitch.,toxr3g
"Now, I hate Ukrainians more.
This is heartbroken.",toxr3g
"This is just sad all around. War is making all of us monsters, all due to the small ego of one man.",toxr3g
"Damn, glory to Ukraine an' all, but that's harsh",toxr3g
Distasteful.,toxr3g
"I understand they‚Äôre invaders, but abusing the mother is still not good

This is just sad",toxr3g
"This brought tears of joy to my eyes. The more Russians feel even 1/100th of the pain they inflicted on millions of Ukranian families, the better.",toxr3g
[deleted],toxr3g
Shit like this and the massive propaganda from Ukrainian side is slowly turning my opinion on the Ukrainian army.,toxr3g
"I think that Ukrainian soldiers should continue doing this, contacting the relatives of the dead Russians. They should even send a photo of the body. This would drive the Russian people to oppose the invasion and Putin's regime. The majority of the Russian people have no idea what is happening in Ukraine (especially the lower class, whose sons are now at war there). Sending photos directly to their whatsapp etc. contacts could speed up the end of the war.

I understand that this is kind of a horrible act for the relatives of the fallen soldiers, but yeah... killing civilians is much worse.",toxr3g
Well deserved,toxr3g
What does the text say in the WhatsApp notification at the end of the video?,toxr3g
They should have called her on video and show her the boy. Send her pictures or something....,toxr3g
"-Do you know Iliusa?  - Yes, of course, he's my boy, what happened?  - a thousand awkward to say but iliusa is no longer alive .. -well, what happened?  - he got lost in my homeland by mistake and because of this he was killed.  -who am I talking to?  -Talk to the one whose comrades killed him.  iliusa died in a foreign land at the behest of strangers
Something like that",toxr3g
Pretty fucked up if u ask me. But that's war,toxr3g
Kind of fucked up. By her demeanor I guess she thinks it's a prank/scam call.,toxr3g
"if this mother was against the war and anti putin he just made many mothers wanting revenge. this isn't a joke. it's a war. mocking a mother over the dead of his son is completely fucked up no matter the circumstances. this is sad and doesn't help anyone. doesn't help ukraine or ukranians. it's a shame.  
they should and could take good care of pow and tell the truth to the soldiers families and not mock them on their face. I support ukraine but I'm completely against this kind of behaviour. it's disgusting.",toxr3g
This is war. Modesty is out of question. But the language of kindness is understood by all humanity.,toxr3g
The guys who uploaded this are honestly lucky as hell that Putin isn't being transparent about this war because this clip could easily end up circulating on Russian TV as anti-Ukrainian propaganda.,toxr3g
https://www.reddit.com/r/AskARussian/comments/tpdq8t/the_fuck_are_ukrainian_soldiers_doing/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share,toxr3g
Not the correct way to do things. He should have shown empathy and blamed her sons death on Putin. This guy is creating more enemies.,toxr3g
As a mother to a son serving in the military (US) this is awful. I understand his rage but fuck him for being an asshole while telling a mother she lost her child. She didn't choose to have her kid sent there. This helps no one and only drives a bigger wedge between sides. Only way he could have been worse is sending her pictures.,toxr3g
"The coward who called this mum to tell her son is dead while cursing and insulting him is nothing more than a punk, a bitch. No matters what side you‚Äôre on, you got to respect mothers and their pain. They‚Äôre innocent. Disgusting bitch.",toxr3g
"Wish he had of said ' your son came here illegally and  tried to kill us. Now he had been killed.""",toxr3g
"Typical behaviour from unprofessional savages, what has the war got to do with his mum. When this war breaches our main land, Great Britain is reclaiming the empire.",toxr3g
Good way to lose any support from Europe. I was for Ukraine but after seeing the pow videos and now this I‚Äôd be asking Boris to back down.,toxr3g
"If this is indicative of the type of people Ukrainians are, fuck'em. Maybe Putin was right. Kill the Nazi fucks.",toxr3g
"The Russian military are actively targeting civilians. Children, babies, pregnant women, grandmas, hospitals, schools, etc. ...everyone. So tbh, even though I am a mother myself and can't imagine the horror of getting this phone call, I kind of get it because FUCK them for raising sons who will either kill with delight or kill civilians on orders because it's fucking disgusting what these invaders are doing.",toxr3g
Seen a couple of these now. Seems set up,toxr3g
"thats grewsome but understandable to do it since the Russian publics loves and is used to be lied at. To tell the mother that in this way is cruel but maybe she is freaking out and tells about it on the street somewhere in Russia. Many Germans loved to be lied at by the Nazis and believed in the ""F√ºhrer"" asshole until the very end. everything that shortens the war is welcome!

"1) The US would not tolerate Russian nukes near our border, hence Cuban Missile Crisis. If Ukraine went NATO, that would be a distinct possibility for Russia in addition to the NATO states it already has on its border. 

2) If Ukraine aligned with the west, Russia would have a very long, very crossable border vulnerable to a potential adversary. More so than any time in Russian history for centuries?

3) Ukraine has natural gas reserves that could be valuable to Russia, particularly in Crimea. Energy is a key sector in Russia. 

4) Ukraine shut off water supplies to Crimea after 2014, and Russia has had a hard time supplying the area. 

5) There have been ongoing disputes over the gas pipeline going through Ukraine from Russia for years.

We should sympathise with Russia. Not Putin. 2 different things since it's not a democracy.,t8m7iq
"Not sympathise, but understand.

If Ukraine developped its 2012 natural gas ressources, it would be the end of Russia's economy.

In the mindset of a superpower, having the allianced made initially to counter you slowly absorb your old vassals is scary, especially if it creates a geographic weakness.

However, both of these could have been avoided if they just stopped just threatening, and instead used soft power. Make a better bond with Ukraine, help them finance their developement of their petrochemical industry and in exchange have it managed by gazprom, whatever so the benefits are shared.

But no. Russia is a dying empire that only thinks from a top down perspective.

If I can't take half of the cake then none of us will have any of it, is the Russian way.

They're a country that was feared worldwide, but has been in decline for quite some time now. Gives them an illusion of grandeur. I pity them in a way.",t8m7iq
"Yes ! If you are a serial killer, you should feel for your own",t8m7iq
"Bro nothing of this is true , russia is an expansionist country thats all you need to know , they have attacked georgia , khazakistan , criam , and probs baltic regions if they were not in nato , it has nothing to do with ukraine , it has only to do with russia and their brain damaged society",t8m7iq
"I personally cannot, but if you look up Mearshimer on youtube you can find a very intelligent man who can.",t8m7iq
It‚Äôs obvious why he did. For years Russia has said it doesn‚Äôt want nato expansion even before Putin. So what the US did was start the color revolutions and then the 2014 resolution installing government they approve that will be open to Ukraine joining nato. Push a great power to the edge and it‚Äôs going to act very aggressive. During the Cubs missile crisis The US was in defcon 5 and aids where telling Kennedy to bomb the place to teach the world a lesson. But instead we punished the entire country for 3 generations thank god. Ukraine should‚Äôve divorced with the US a long time ago work with Western Europe for a neutrality agreement on its behalf.,t8m7iq
"There are two sides to a story. Whether you believe it is irrelevant, it what they believe and how they deal with it. 

I have to say though that many people really don‚Äôt understand the background to this conflict. It didn‚Äôt just happen in the last couple of weeks, it‚Äôs been brewing strongly for a decade.",t8m7iq
So... no?,t8m7iq
"If you‚Äôre into podcasts, Hood Politics recently did an episode on the current situations. It‚Äôs not the best explanation, but it helped me understand the situation more easily.",t8m7iq
No good reason to symphatise with Putin.,t8m7iq

"It‚Äôs pork lard, so that when Chechnya‚Äôs Muslim soldiers die from these bullets they don‚Äôt go to Heaven.",t30bak
psychological warfare is always a thing.,t30bak
Come on guys not every Muslim is a  terrorist,t30bak
I think any invader on Ukraine's soil deserves the most horrible death ever. That's why it's a war.,t30bak
Don‚Äôt glorify these nazis,t30bak
"Of fucking course it would be Azov doing some dumb shit like this.  You can slay Russian invaders without being a sectarian piece of shit like this.  

They‚Äôve got reservists doing it.  These guys are a straight up neo-nazi paramilitary group, and it shows.",t30bak
"It's weird to think that God is some inflexible computing algorithm that will calculate coldly a result based on some sort of input. God is a person, and He can simply decide to let muslims who get hit with pork-laced bullets into Heaven because He's God and He says it's fine. God is not trapped by rules. He is not some cruel machine that will condemn a soul for all of foreverness because a piece of metal pushed biological cells of a specific kind into the body. A soul doesn't go to heaven or hell based on something so shallow -- Heaven shouldn't even be the motivation for a religion, but instead the desire should be relationship with God and Heaven a biproduct of that relationship, and when you have a good relationship with someone, there is grace and forgiveness and not caring that pork was in your body upon death. It's simple.",t30bak
Another Azov video of them not fighting anyone. Typical! Lol,t30bak
"The psychological effect that would have is immense. The enemy believes there fighting for there god. However if they die fighting for there god they will not make it to paradise, terrifying prospect for them.",t30bak
"I see this page has turned into just another hate speech page, seems like Ukrainians are forgetting who they are fighting against",t30bak
Hope this azov militia gets wiped out,t30bak
Is it a war crime to do that to someone‚Äôs religion and also spreading things on weapons that will increase infection like that,t30bak
"Yeah, I think it‚Äôs a bit icky tbh. A little hardcore lol",t30bak

"You're going to get hate for this, I'm sure. I appreciate your art though, even if it's easier for a lot of people right now to hate all Russians then to recognize that there are some good people forced into horrible situations. 

But then again I speak from the comfort of America and as much disgust and contempt I hold for the Russian army I can only imagine the black hole of hatred formed in the hearts of people closer to the conflict. That kind of hate, however justified, doesn't leave room for much nuance, as I'm sure the comments you receive will tell you.",uu7q3l

"So much unneeded hate here, but it reminds me of ww2 and how dehumanising all was against the German army. Of course rightfully so, but not all were bad, 13-19 forced to wear a target uniform, German uniform, and hold a gun. They were all young, easy to brainwash and control by fear. I recall back to that famous picture of that crying captured German boy at 16 years old. He only joined the army because both his parents died and he had to care for his little siblings, trying to make some quick cash or something. Humans can become monsters, so scary,  and cruel when war begins and one side a group that does a bunch of horrible things to blame their own, yet behind that mask of war crimes committed , there‚Äôs the boys who hadn‚Äôt done a thing, beaten and abused by their commanders, ripped away from their mothers and put into a combat outfit. 

Thank you for this beautiful art breaking away from hatred and showing the reality that goes on and how most feel. The ones that are innocent, I‚Äôm glad not everyone is one-siding and calling every Russian a disgrace.",uu7q3l

"Yeah, Putins military looking like a joke on the world stage was what he intended. K. ggwp, Putin. You sure showed us!",truh94
Some very good points about getting Zelensky to promise neutrality and getting the gas wealth.  But he lost a lot of prestige for Russia and will not recover economically in his lifetime.,truh94
"This is the dumbest hot take I have ever seen, he just needs to add ""and think of the billions he can stuff into his pockets because he doesn't have to pay to maintain all those soldiers, tanks, missiles and ships! The man is a genius!"" 

Truly 6D chess there.",truh94
"Excerpt because behind paywall: 

Suppose for a moment that Putin never intended to conquer all of Ukraine: that, from the beginning, his real targets were the energy riches of Ukraine‚Äôs east, which contain Europe‚Äôs second-largest known reserves of natural gas (after Norway‚Äôs).

Combine that with Russia‚Äôs previous territorial seizures in Crimea (which has huge offshore energy fields) and the eastern provinces of Luhansk and Donetsk (which contain part of an enormous shale-gas field), as well as Putin‚Äôs bid to control most or all of Ukraine‚Äôs coastline, and the shape of Putin‚Äôs ambitions become clear. He‚Äôs less interested in reuniting the Russian-speaking world than he is in securing Russia‚Äôs energy dominance.

‚ÄúUnder the guise of an invasion, Putin is executing an enormous heist,‚Äù said Canadian energy expert David Knight Legg. As for what‚Äôs left of a mostly landlocked Ukraine, it will likely become a welfare case for the West, which will help pick up the tab for resettling Ukraine‚Äôs refugees to new homes outside of Russian control. In time, a Viktor Orban-like figure could take Ukraine‚Äôs presidency, imitating the strongman-style of politics that Putin prefers in his neighbors.

If this analysis is right, then Putin doesn‚Äôt seem like the miscalculating loser his critics make him out to be.

It also makes sense of his strategy of targeting civilians. More than simply a way of compensating for the incompetence of Russian troops, the mass killing of civilians puts immense pressure on Zelensky to agree to the very things Putin has demanded all along: territorial concessions and Ukrainian neutrality. The West will also look for any opportunity to de-escalate, especially as we convince ourselves that a mentally unstable Putin is prepared to use nuclear weapons.

Within Russia, the war has already served Putin‚Äôs political purposes. Many in the professional middle class ‚Äî the people most sympathetic to dissidents like Aleksei Navalny ‚Äî have gone into self-imposed exile. The remnants of a free press have been shuttered, probably for good. To the extent that Russia‚Äôs military has embarrassed itself, it is more likely to lead to a well-aimed purge from above than a broad revolution from below. Russia‚Äôs new energy riches could eventually help it shake loose the grip of sanctions.

This alternative analysis of Putin‚Äôs performance could be wrong. Then again, in war, politics and life, it‚Äôs always wiser to treat your adversary as a canny fox, not a crazy fool.",truh94
"That's why he fired 8 senior officials one week in, and is hanging out in a Siberian mountain bunker now after donating 300 million dollars in armor?",truh94
Also the fact the Ukrainians have more armor now than they did before the war began is hilarious. So much for demilitarization more like remilitarization. ‚ò†Ô∏èü§£,truh94

"Russia currently has more resources than they can use. The country covers 11% of the usable land mass on the planet.  They have relied on Western Oil companies to get it out of the ground. A little more will not make a difference. It is something to think about, but extremely unlikely.",truh94

Mostly ASAF though.. if you keep watching the airports near the border and wait for transponders to come on, you'll see at least 5 distinct Blackhawks each day. 

Also keep an eye on British airspace. They have had several fighter jets leave British airspace and head east... But.. as soon as they leave British airspace, they disable their transponders.

There's Americans in Ukraine. There has been since 1991, and increasing numbers since 2014. The volunteers are not active duty. The active duty are not fighting, and that's not because we are hiding or claiming that. It's because we don't loan out our soldiers to fight.

It is the XM-5, which is basically the same lower, but the upper has a belt feeder, quick change barrel and an open bolt. The reason I say that you may be confused is that the ammunition, .277 Sig Fury, is not in full rate production yet. A gun like that would starve in Ukraine, meaning there would be no ammo.

"You will not get a ""genuine"" report. It doesn't exist. Polls were done by different agencies and show about 55 to 65 percent of Russian population in support of this ""operation"" depending on a poll. My own guess is that it represents reality, but hard to verify whether or not these statistics were influenced in any way.",thwc9j
"This is why in any country freedom is as important or more important than democracy. Without freedom of the press and freedom of speech, government will control information, block information sources, and manipulate the public to support them.

It sadly seems true that Putin has widespread support among Russians, because for years now they've seen only the narrative he wants them to see. Until a month ago there were a few small dissenting media outlets, but in the last month he's shut them all down and blocked websites that won't follow his censorship rules (e.g. blocking Facebook and Instagram and heavily restricting Twitter.)

Over time the Russian public will gradually see the differences between what they're being told and reality - the economic collapse, their sons returning in body bags, realizing they've been shut off from the rest of the world, etc. - but by then it will be too dangerous to express any dissent.",thwc9j
"When you write ""this war"", you have to know that a majority will have a completely misinformed view of what is going on, and their opinion is connected to that view. E. G., if you're buying the ""denazification"" part, then who would not be against nazis?",thwc9j

"I was talking to a colleague of mine, who talks to people in the smallish (under 500k) city in Russia over the phone. Anyone who he talks to is over 50 years old. According to him they are all experiencing something that can be compared to euphoria during Olympic Games when your team is winning. They all cheer and all their problems are now somehow connected to Ukrainians and once they are defeated there will be paradise in the motherland. 

I would say 85% who was an adult when Soviet Union collapsed (they would be 55 by now) are pro-war. Their sentiment that Ukraine and Russia are the same people is exaggerated by a prolonged propaganda that spanned for over 10 years.",thwc9j
"I would argue if more then 20% of Russians population didnt agree with the war, russia would be idk over throwing their goverment. Its believable that 80% are okay with the war because they don't have major civil unrest in their country over the war. 

Don't get me wrong there are large protest.... but not big enough. Russia has like 144 million people in their country if they wanted to stop their government they could. 

Most russians want to just throw their hands up and be nonpartisan out of fear. To me its shameful for all of them.",thwc9j
"Nobody can tell you about the majority of the population, because the polls are not reliable in this situation, so you can only get reports from small personal bubbles. My experience (I'm Russian but have been living in the West for over a decade): I do not know anyone in Russia who is cheering the war as such. Some (mostly older people) approve what Putin is doing because""he had no other choice"" . Why? Because they've been shown kids from Donetsk and Luhansk regions killed by the Ukrainian army. They were being shown that for 8 years. Some parts of my extended family fled from these regions to Russia and told of the violence from first-hand experience. So for these people, the invasion is justified and called special operation. 
Other parts of my family are calling it a war and do not approve, to a various degree. None is ready to come out and protest, mainly because it's very unsafe to do due to Russian laws and deep seated perception that protests are useless. 
Personally I'm very much against the war and think it's a shame on Russia, but then I'm pretty much integrated in the western society by now.",thwc9j
"Call ten Russians and say ‚ÄúHello. We‚Äôre collecting data. Do you support Putin?‚Äù  

What do you think they‚Äôd say? Seems like it would be impossible to get good data.",thwc9j
"That‚Äôs the thing with dictatorships, it‚Äôs impossible to know really what people think. It‚Äôs not just that democracy is fairer, it is also important because it really helps us understand what people really think. Also it shows that societies are not monolithic.

Nevertheless there is a deeper question regarding whether Russians, as a whole, are responsible for their government actions. I think they are. Germans were responsible for what their government did during WWII.",thwc9j
"The Russian people are in a bubble of state controlled media, only being fed info that supports the war. They're told Ukrainians are nazis, their own boys and men are brave heroes, and that they're having unmitigated success in battle. If they're not tech savvy enough to find alternative media, or they're too blinded by propaganda to listen/believe alternative media when they do see it, then they're going to believe the Russian state media. If they knew what was really happening, I have trouble believing the majority would back an unprovoked war of choice, that includes no regard for civilian lives and is leading to horrific losses of their own soldiers.

Remember back to 2003, Americans were gearing up for war with Iraq in a similar but much less tightly controlled media environment. People were furious with France just because they didn't back us unilaterally changing the Hussein regime... they didn't try to stop us, they just didn't support it. Most Americans were ready to send our troops to fight, kill, and die over spotty intelligence, in a country that had nothing to do with 9/11, and said ""fuck you"" to anybody who suggested otherwise. Now we know for sure what happened, that the intel was bullshit, and that we were led into a war of choice that cost hundreds of thousands of lives and trillions of dollars under false pretenses.

Now imagine back in 2003 that the *only US news* was Fox News, that they never gave air time to anyone who opposed the war, and that they never showed or acknowledged any of the human costs of the war. That alternative media online was getting actively blocked. That protesters were getting beaten, rounded up, and arrested, but that was never shown on the news. That's why, to me, it's not hard to imagine why the average Russian doesn't know what's going on and shows at least some tacit support for the war. Older Russians seem even more susceptible to state propaganda, or at least much less likely to find alternative perspectives.

To be clear, I'm only comparing the media environments Americans were living in back in 03 to the one Russians are in today. No more.",thwc9j
"I don‚Äôt think it matters that much if it is 20 or 80 percent of the Russian population that support the war. It is very unlikely that there will be enough protests to make much of a difference. 

And most importantly, if you meet any Russians in person, you cannot know, if they don‚Äôt choose to tell you, which side they are on. So don‚Äôt judge people based on where they happened to be born. No one had any choice in that matter.",thwc9j

"There could be some sort of face-saving compromise. Ukraine can put an some anti-Nazi clause in their constitution and promise to not join NATO, while pursuing a separate defense pact with the US like Japan or South Korea. He can say ""mission accomplished"" and try to get his domestic problems under control, because the one thing Putin wants most is to stay in power.",teeify

Well, I guess they had that fat guy who got up on a tank in Moscow, but unfortunately he was an ignorant, drunken buffoon who's last memorable act as Russian president was to put Putin into power... <sigh>.",teeify
"The questions is, if Putin were offered the option to keep Crimea and the former rebel held areas, with Ukraine agreeing not fo join NATO, would he accept that! Would it be face saving enough for him after the heavy Russian deaths and losses?   And would the Ukranian people accept that after all the death and destruction Putin has caused? Not good for either, but at least it ends the fighting and people can begin to rebuild. And the population of Crimea and the rebel ld areas seemed to want to be with Russia anyway?  Not a pleasant resolution, but at least it ends further bloodshed and destruction.  Seems the best but imperfect end to this mess.",teeify

"Right. I would expect, being a BBC license payer, that before raising this, it is verified by journalists we already have on the ground, not taken from social media posts. There is no context. Otherwise, we can all start our own YouTube news channels based on social media posts. If the guards are really discriminating on the basis of race, we should put pressure on Ukraine to find them and remove them from train guard duty. However, we aren't going to believe Russians pointing this out and I don't think the BBC should be taken at face value either if it is simply using social media as its basis for reporting.",t3j7df
"Bad and there is no excuse about this. I am all pro Ukraine but that isn't good at all. 

Even if their countries did not bother to take them it is the humane thing to do, those are people not government officials. And if we go down this road we can also argue that Ukraine didn't take care of its citizens and it is not other countries responsobility to take care of them.

This also do not mean automatically that Ukrainian people are bad. There are bad people everywhere and in any country and they should be punished, fined etc. And it can't be used as mean to show that they are some kind of Nazis because earlier today we saw a lot of people from Odessa university who are from Africa who already moved to Romania or Poland.

Either way one or few incidents or some misguided believe that Ukranians should be saved first do not speak for the whole country.",t3j7df

Even if Russia gains a few feet they are losing not hundreds but thousands of soldiers and non replaceable equipment,wl0qif
"2km gained, airport lost in Crimea. Seems a fine short term trade off.",wl0qif
"TAKING KYIV WOULD BE A ""SIGNIFICANT PUSH"", NOW THEY ARE DYING TO TAKE A SQARE FOOT....",wl0qif
"There has been intense fighting in that area for about a month,....  it's been contested for about 2 weeks, they finally confirmed Ruzzian occupy it. In other words,.... hardly significant gain for one month,...",wl0qif
"Tactical retreats are necessary in warfare like this. Ukrainians need to quickly regroup when they‚Äôre outgunned by the Russians, but I think we can all agree, Ukrainians are doing a much better job of countering Russian advances due to their skilled regrouping movements. 

A lot of the trench battles in the east trade lines every other day between UA and Z.",wl0qif
"AFAIK this part is one of the hottest places of the war with highest density of troops from both sides.

Russians have almost unlimited supply of cannon fodder, but Ukrainian defenses here were built since 2015, they are deep and developed. Half a year of fighting and russians were able to move only 1-2 km forward - kinda says smthing",wl0qif
So.. After ~~-7 months-~~ 8 years they finally managed to advance about 300m? **UNSTOPPABLE JUGGERNAUT!!**,wl0qif
"Territorial gains are here insignificant as Russia concentrates artillery. Under that stupid shelling it makes sense to evade targeted ordinary troops. At the same time, they cannot continue to advance eternally in counter-battery fire. The defender is in advantage.",wl0qif
"Russia is flopping, gasping.",wl0qif
Apparently they have like a 1/3 of the their entire force there. So you have to be strategic in how you defend against those kind of numbers,wl0qif
whats that for an Map?,wl0qif
Then maybe the 145 million of you should overthrow your dictator. Enough is enough,t4p8nb
"More need to get out and protest. I‚Äôm not Russian but looking in from the outside it seems that people are afraid to fight back against their government.

If the EU moves forward with a plan to offer safe haven to Russian military members who don‚Äôt want any part of the war there goes everything down the hole lol.,t4p8nb
"Agreed. War has always proved to be a fail, same with the war on drugs when you try to tackle a situation, it makes it worse off when you use violence.",t4p8nb
There are definitely Russians who support Putin! At this point it's time to go to war. Whether it's today or tomorrow the men in the west will be drafted because is not going to stop with you Ukraine. So let's just get it over with it,t4p8nb

"It's war it happens. And, where're the CLUs.

This only means MORE assistance needed.",tf5mqn
If Russia is curious about who has supplied weapons to Ukraine they could just simply read the news instead of wasting their time on a scavenger hunt. It's not like it isn't public knowledge,tf5mqn

"This is actually a great sign for Ukraine. It means that NATO equipment is getting to the front where it is needed. You are always going to lose equipment in war. It's the nature of the beast. It's a bad sign for Russia, because it means every fucking Ukrainian on earth will soon be able to have a NLAW, Javalin, or Panzerfaust if they would like one.

Uh oh,tf5mqn
"They can't really do anything with it, except for immediately using it on the battlefield (if they know how to operate it). They don't have the capabilities to reverse engineer it, reproduce it with domestic industries. But most importantly, they are broke. They likely already have access of such technology in some way (through China possibly), but just can't afford to use it as a general front-line weapon.

And people who are worried about China. China has their own Javelin copy already, so not that it is something new for them.",tf5mqn
Is it good idea to put tracking device in it n let them take it on purposely?,tf5mqn

The west is sending THOUSANDS of the things to Ukraine.",tf5mqn
eat some more shit russia and choke on it,tf5mqn
"Its rediculous that we have to play these games with Russia and let them dictate on what aid or help we can provide another country in need of help. Seriously, we need to provide a mo fly zone over Ukraine, let the Russians call it what they want but our only goal is to protect innocent lives.

I wonder how many takes it took to get the right footage?   Pure propaganda and has been posted before.

Half ass camouflage that still has a man made shape is still easy to spot.,ugnz26
"Given the range of most Iskander variants, they probably don't need to worry too much about camouflage. They probably aren't anywhere near Ukraine, and getting a Bayraktar all the way out to where this video was taken probably isn't worth the risk.

The good news is that it looks like Russia's ability to quickly produce more of these missiles is very limited. They don't have massive cold-war stockpiles of these things like they do Grad rockets or artillery shells. Russia has already had to cut back on their use of these long-range, guided missiles because they simply don't have enough to maintain the tempo they were used at when the war started.",ugnz26

Trump should be imprisoned and deleted. I'm no Biden fan either but he's done a helluva better job the RumpT",wjc101
"Not a big Trump fan but he didn't actually do anything to support Russia. Sure, he was critical of NATO, but if you look at the reasons it was because many of our NATO allies have not invested in mutual defense. Ukraine getting invaded kind of proves the point. The US, UK, and Poland come though big and then you have countries like Spain or Germany which have done shit from a military perspective. Trumps whole point was ""why should we defend countries who won't defend themselves"". That perspective has pretty much been validated in Ukraine, as the US is essentially carrying the NATO response to this conflict. 

Footnote: I'm sure there's plenty of people who will downvote me simply because I didn't say Trump was the anti-christ, but ask yourself: Why is the EU, which has a similar GDP to the US, contributing less to the war effort (which is in their own back yard) than the US? It's because they don't have enough equipment to donate, because they haven't invested in such equipment for decades.",wjc101

"Whenever any media mentions them, remember to include their new title, ""representation x, who voted to continue funding russian genocide""",tys2ra
"Part of the republicans, fox new and a realy big part of the MAGA's are so hateful against their libtard neighbours they'd rather have an autocratic leader to feel strong in a group and get funding from Putler. Like Orban's Hungary.",tys2ra
"Traitors, every last fucking one of them add Trump to it.",tys2ra
Tbh the most surprising thing about this to me is that Lauren Boebert is not also in that list of repubs lol,tys2ra
Republican? There's two democrats on there. The two extremes on both sides need to go.,tys2ra
All nut jobs especially Green. She‚Äôs almost as crazy as Trump.,tys2ra
Jfc this is why the American far left is a joke. They cannot help but act like fucking tankies.,tys2ra
It tough bribing officials with frozen bank accounts. I guess these 9 were just cheap.,tys2ra

The ultra extremes of both sides. Fucking psychos hate America.,tys2ra
Scumbags. No surprises here.,tys2ra
Marge Green and Matt Gaetz probably stay up at night txting Ilhan Omar and Cori Bush about how they can work together to stir up their bases.  Traitors all.,tys2ra
Oh no people have different opinions than perfect me. Must be because they‚Äôre on Putin‚Äôs payroll. How could it be any other way?,tys2ra
Wtf is wrong with Gaetz!? What a poon.  Ilhan I expect,tys2ra
Why did the shitlibs vote no?,tys2ra
I don‚Äôt agree with this but cool that you did some work in making your point though.,tys2ra

Slava Ukraini",tys2ra
"We should ban all of Russian oil etc. It will drive up the price of gas very much but so what! Americans, we are all rich, we can pay $20-$30 gallon of gas, so what! So we do not have enough money to buy our medicine or groceries, SO WHAT! I have a electric car that gets its electricity from a coal or gas powered electric plant. I am willing to sacrifice everything to protect another countries border/sovereignty!",tys2ra
Shills? Because they voted against a bill that will fuck over Russian citizens? Fuck Russians? There not human? Where the fuck are we going if this is everyone‚Äôs line of thought? We‚Äôre going to war. And if this shit gets out of hand there will be a draft. Are you guys cool with that? Are you cool with xenophobia so long as it‚Äôs media approved?  What the actual factual fuck are you talking about?,tys2ra
Maybe their constituents didn‚Äôt want them to. Aren‚Äôt they suppose to vote the way the people under their governance demands?,tys2ra
"Maybe, just maybe they don‚Äôt give two fucks about anything Russia because we obviously have our own damn problems here in our country, on our continent to worry about‚Ä¶But let‚Äôs keep bickering amongst ourselves for eternity because that will teach those politicians in D.C‚Ä¶We‚Äôre fucked.",tys2ra
Trying to lynch people for having a different opinion. How Putinlike.,tys2ra
"  Strongly held, well thought-out belief?


       Or‚Ä¶. Maybe corrupt payoff??",tys2ra
"Wouldnt even be a question If our scumbag leader Joe Biden would open The keystone XL pipeline back up and start relying on our own fossil fuels again instead of every other country That would be nice!!

"Is there anything to think about? The amount of war crimes committed by Russia right now is unfathomable and of course a desperate defender will do whatever it takes. When civilian areas are currently being bombed and destroyed already with many casualties, what does anyone even expect them to do in their own country? Follow international law and not place weaponry in civilian areas? Practically all of Kyiv might as well be all things considered. 

The alternative is to weaken your positions and your defence and open yourselves up to the potential of losing a battle and creating further loss of life. It's the reality of war. I think the world would understand and not give a fuck what Ukraine is currently doing to try and defend their country from being taken over by an authoritarian regime run by a clearly insane dictator pushing his selfish will onto innocents, who will blow up his own people for false flags and murder his own people if they oppose him and his propaganda and tell the truth. 

If this were my country, I wouldn't care if artillery were being set up on top of a school, you do what it takes it win, to defend your country and stop those invading it.

"I think it looks like fake.

1. aviation and drones of the Russian Federation would have detected the deployment of the battery, and destroyed it even before the end of this process. Ukrainians cannot afford such an open stance and stick to guerrilla warfare.
2. This is very similar to the 2015 year (or about) LDNR tactics. I remember a photo of their placement of the d-30 in residential areas. I think this photo is from that time.

"Also an untrue interpretation of the Humanitarian Law. 

It would be legit if it was placed in something like an active hospital, but on the recognised frontline of a conflict it's a reasonable assumption that civilians will evacuate and placement of these howitzers fulfills the requirement for 'military necessity.'

Besides, the laws assume combatants are using civilian areas to avoid being targeted; when we know the Russians don't care if somewhere is occupied by civilians or not before targeting.",t22aoc

Your move Russia.",whmgkb
"We here in the US stand by our product. If for any reason your HIMARS is lost or stolen, we will send a replacement free of charge. üëå",whmgkb
HIGHLY doubt that UKR is getting HIMARS anywhere close enough for a ruskie drone to find it and definitely not close enough for ruskie arty to hit it. This is just another pathetic attempt at russ propaganda.,whmgkb
The HIMARS have been hunting in packs.  Can't see any additional vehicles there. Although image is horrid.,whmgkb
"Even if the Russians did destroy one of the HIMARS it doesn't really matter.  The US has over 500 of the HIMARS and between the US and Europe there are 1300 M270 that launch the same rockets.  The only real value of destroying a HIMARS is Russian domestic propaganda consumption.  I think the chances are higher that the Russians destroy a HIMARS if the Ukrainians park them next to a school, hospital, playground, mall or bus stop.",whmgkb
I swear. the russians are the only ones who make their videos worse in post processing. That looks like the 2001 video footage,whmgkb

Looked like 1 big explosion.... Himars would almost be many explosions..I dont believe the video and its so grainy.,whmgkb
Russia destroyed 234 out of 8,whmgkb
"I mean it's possible they got one here (I can't visually confirm it this could be anything they're hitting here) but if we count every claim by RuZZia of ""destroyed himars"" there should be 500 destroyed HIMARS by now ...",whmgkb
"This fixation with finding and destroying HIMARS is really hysterical. Like what's gonna happen, you blow up one and you think what? USA isn't gonna send in a replacement? Maybe even more...",whmgkb
Gotta be on a hero dose of copium if you think any himars are being hidden innawoods to be blowed up,whmgkb
Maybe we should crowdfund the Russian Forces better cameras so we can see when they're lying in HD,whmgkb
"This video shows in the action the russian powerful weapon system called ""Pizdiozh"".",whmgkb

Russia has destroyed more HIMARS than actually exist. Incredibly effective military.,whmgkb
They've *destroyed* more HIMARS then Ukraine has,whmgkb
anyone have the serial number to check warranty status?,whmgkb
Bullshit I bet.,whmgkb

Definitely looks like 6 missiles blowing up at the same time... pause... NOT!,whmgkb
Why is the Russian stuff always blurry as fuck?,whmgkb

Lol another ambulance aka HIMARS to Russia.. pretty well any vehicle they blow up is one nowadays,whmgkb
Notice the really shitty video evidence...üò≥,whmgkb
"Lat week they said, 2 HIMARS were destroyed on the 3rd floor of a building! Always somewhere where you cant' see anything, like in this video in a forest. They could claim it was Big Foot, or Hitler's bunker...",whmgkb
"I have no idea why people don‚Äôt laugh this ridiculous claim away. Ukraine is going to just allow a Russian drone to linger over a HIMARS which by the way is alone and isn‚Äôt taking evasive measures.

Nonsense. It‚Äôs probably General 350lbs‚Äô food truck.",whmgkb
"Everytime Russia talks about destroyed HIMARS, they never show it clearly.",whmgkb
Those Russians wouldn‚Äôt recognize a himars if it was flaunting flag saying ‚ÄúI‚Äôm a himars‚Äù.,whmgkb
This could be anything. Terrible video quality,whmgkb
"Now the orcs have destroyd 500 HIMARS and the airdefense units they allways has with them. Then it‚Äôs only 700 of them left. Damn you russia! You destroy all HIMARS, are losing the war and will have an economic colaps in two years.",whmgkb

"Well Russia will eventually take the land as they have a never ending supply of lemmings.  Ukraine will inflict extremely high cost VS gain..

"""gaining ground"" in the east is something that changes literally from day to day, even hour to hour. Russia can gain ground in one day, and lose it all the next. Same with Ukraine. 

But this is a semi-accurate map of what's going on. But things to change rapidly on the micro-scale

[https://liveuamap.com](https://liveuamap.com)",vbre91
"Ukraine - Current situation if you aren't keeping up with the news. (Reposted as a response to my friends but its 90% on topic)

Ukraine and Russia have bogged down into a stalemate, which is unfortunately to Russia's advantage. Ukraine is better at maneuver warfare, while Russia's military much more designed to just grind forward. Russia is stripping troops from the other parts of Ukraine to make a big push on Severodonetsk in the East which is the last part of Luhansk Oblast (Oblast is similar to State/Province) that Russia doesn't hold. Luhansk plus Donestk Oblasts form the Donbas region which is a part of Ukraine Putin has committed to the Russian public to capturing.

Russia to this end has shifted a significant amount of their artillery (of which they have a LOT) and are shelling this region heavily.

The Ukraine army appears (this is a bit of conjecture on my part) to have allowed Russian forces to take the eastern half of Severodonetsk (largely residential) and so they can fight them at extremely short ranges in the city. This is know as hugging, which can be effective in this situation - basically you stay engaged with the enemy forces at such short ranges, they can not use artillery on your positions without hitting their own troops due to the inaccuracy of artillery. Plus urban areas give a lot more protection against artillery.

This is why you see a change in what's being sent to Ukraine as before they needed anti-tank and anti-air weapons, now they need artillery and lots of it. Ukraine has warned they are running out of soviet era artillery ammunition for the artillery they inherited during the collapse of the Soviet Union. So finding supplies of that ammo is critical as well supplying newer artillery weapons and ammo.

Ukraine appears to be using the fact Russia has stripped troops from the other areas of occupied Ukraine to start counter-attacks in these weakened areas. The counter attacks do seem to be proceeding well but so fair haven't achieved results that would change the situation, in particular the attacks need to advance far enough to cut Russia occupied highway supply routes.

There are more and more reports of Ukraine units having serious morale issues and  smaller units routing (fleeing) from the front - specifically the units that have been fighting in the Donbas region and that have been under heavy artillery shelling for over 100 days. It appears Ukraine is trying to bring in rested units that haven't seen heavy action since Russia retreated from Kyiv - but this is a worrisome development as many of the Ukrainian units in the most critical areas have been suffering the same shelling and may be near their breaking points as well.

Ukraine will not want to fall back and hand over more terrain to Russia but the good news is if they do the terrain that Ukraine will withdraw into is very advantageous in most areas. Ukraine will be falling back across a river (it's wide but not deep, you can walk across it) but even a passable river is a defense advantage as well as the fact the Ukraine side of the river is on average 400-650 feet higher than the Russia controlled side. Not a huge hill but any kind of high ground is an advantage.

Russia does continue to show serious equipment supply issues - Russia just deployed T-62s (built in the 60s and very out of date even compared to the T-64 which is designed a few years later) to its secure rear areas in Ukraine. On one hand this makes sense as in 2018 they refreshed 120 T-62s to test how quickly they could ready their older tanks in storage. The tanks being deployed are certainly among those refreshed in that exercise. BUT to have reached these tanks means that 85%-90% of the newer tanks that Russia has in storage are not in condition to be deployed. It was expected a lot of Russia's stored tanks would be unusable but having that rate pushing 90% is way worse that anyone expected.

Russia also continues to have serious manpower issues - they are conscripting males from 18-60 in the occupied areas of Ukraine as well as from areas they occupy in other countries like Georgia. As well they just deployed about 30 new BTG (a Russia unit normally sized at about 800-1500 men) to Ukraine, but they appear to be only at 1/2 their normal strength and composed almost entirely of non combat military personal, (cooks, supply clerks, etc). Despite having a huge population, Russia can't mobilize them because to do that would fly in the face of the propaganda they have been pushing to the Russian public. It would mean admitting they are not winning and casualties are far higher than they have been admitting. To admit either of those issues could potentially be destabilizing for Putin's regime. The Russian public maintains a level of disinterest in what the government is doing that would likely be shattered if they started recalling former conscripts or widened the draft, especially with constant rumors that Ukraine is a slaughterhouse.

All of this means both Ukraine and Russia are in dangerous position. Ukraine is fighting a war on Russia's terms and not able to use its best advantages, is suffering heavy losses and having morale issues in units that have been fighting in the Donbas region since the start of the war. Russia is fighting the type of war its good at but is running out of men and equipment.

If the current front line Ukraine troops break - Russia will likely be able to seize more of the Donbas region but not more territory beyond that due to the damage it's frontline units have taken. If Russia runs out of men and machines to keep up the push, you'll likely see Russian troops dig in where they are and hold ground until Russia can get more. Russia is VERY good at digging in and fighting a defensive war.

In either case, all signs point to a long war where sanctions maybe the best hope to force Russia to negotiate. That being said high gas prices and food shortages/famine in poorer countries looks like our near future.",vbre91
"Afaik Ukraine is inflicting a lot of casualties on russia and is standing its ground quite well, but russia is using its material advantage to gain land while inflicting a lot of casualties themselves - only a week ago or so Zelensky spoke of 100 dead a day and 500 wounded. I do not know how accurate the number is, but there are a lot of Ukranian soldiers dying as well for sure. On the flipside Ukraine seems to make some progress in the south, since russia decided to focus its attention around Sewerdonetsk.

Ukraine does not have enough artillery at the moment to counter the russian artillery, which is one of the main reasons for russias current superiority - I hope more western weapons will help there, especially the promised long range artillery systems, but I don't know if it will be enough. Atm Ukraine is countering the russian material superiority with smart tactics, but that can also only bring you so far.

Summarized: both sides appear to be in a brutal brawl with each other and none are making significant progress (though the operations around Cherson are promising for Ukraine, there is still the fact that russia is making slow progress in Sewerodonetsk), its outcome depends largely on how much the west will send - I am less optimistic than I was some time ago, but with the right help Ukraine will overcome the current situation, no doubt. Without it I think it will lose more territory though step by step and russia might gain a long term foothold and establish its rule in eastern regions of Ukraine.

Thats how I see it. I can't say that I'm unbiased, I strongly support Ukraine, but this is my understanding of the situation based on news reports and the stuff I see here.",vbre91
"Both are true.

Though, the situation on the ground about *taking/liberating* towns, changes every 2 days or so.

I love me some good footage of orc tanks getting blown up sky-high, but I'm sure they are still capable of advances where they concentrate enough orcs to do it.",vbre91
"The Russians are winning from a tactical sense, but I doubt they can go on in the long term. The Russians can't repair or build new equipment while the Ukrainians pretty much have a blank check right now from the west.",vbre91
"But of both. Ukraine is trying to hold the center, while they roll up the flanks. 
There goal is to cut off the Crimea and move east and north kershon region, while squeezing from the north through Kharkiv.
Russia wants to consolidate in Donbas and those areas as they feel they have the most support, problem is, they are killing their supporters. 

Either way, you will see Russia break, in eastern Russia near Mongolian territories. You are starting to see more civil unrest. The federation is splintering as the war goes on.",vbre91
"Were all on team Ukraine here so the only posts are of Russian losses because we can't handle the truth and don't want to see Ukraine's losses, which appear to be 100-200 men a day and slowly losing territory while holding elsewhere.",vbre91
"At the moment, the war suits the Russian style of warfare... which is, horrifically *throw more bodies at the fire until it smothers* so they will keep sending everything in, bit by bit, as they don't want to instigate a larger mass conscription. 

They are pounding the everliving shit out of everything with basic scorched earth tactics that are reminiscent of WW1 advances. 

In saying this, the strategic picture will see them lose on the proviso that the west continues with ongoing and increased aid to replace the older Soviet era munitions with Western kit. 

This is being impacted by the simple fact that the west has been so cocksure of air force superiority turning enemy forces to scrap *i.e every war since 1991* that they have more or less ignored more than tokenistic levels of artillery *even the US is guilty of this, after all how many times have they used million dollar JDAMs to smack an insurgent with a 150 dollar AK-47?*

We're playing catchup, and our politicians are still scared of the nuclear side of the Bear... but they're changing...

... it's only taking multiple events of genocidal activity and a risk of a gIobal food crisis to make them TALK... I fear what they would need to make them walk...",vbre91
Unbiased don't exist.,vbre91
"Then you need to quit reddit.

As both sides resort to downvoting each other, and alt accounts.

You will have tons of children screaming at you ""Your wrong, because you say training is the biggest bottleneck, herp derp""   
Or ""We can just ship them M1 Abrams"".",vbre91
Russia has more manpower/equipment so it can afford more losses than ukraine,vbre91
"Unbiased, two important things are happening. Momentum on the ground is slowly shifting Russia‚Äôs way. But far more important, Russia is doing much better than expected economically while the West is doing worse. On the West‚Äôs side, this is due not so much to the war but rather to economic vulnerabilities that were trending long before the War began, which were then accelerated by sanctions. Inflation is one example but there are others, such as massive debt burdens.

As a result, Russia is in much less hurry to make progress on the ground. They feel that economic pains will erode support for the war in the West, gradually but inevitably. Hope this helps.",vbre91
Russia is an artillery army. They indiscriminately shell everything in front of them that is contested until their enemy is forced to retreat. This allows their infantry to secure once contested positions without any resistance.,vbre91
"So would NATO and the armed forces on both sides.  

The fog of war is thick. 

Ukraine has held Severodonetsk much longer than expected, and many people think that Ukraine has held it longer than they should.  Russians are slowly advancing toward Slovyansk, while Ukraine is aiming for Izyum to break the supply lines.

Ukraine is making small advances, on the order of a few kilometers, on a broad front in northern Kherson and Zaporizhzhia Oblasts.  

Russia in maintaining a buffer between Kharkiv and the Russian border several kilometers wide.",vbre91

"As someone of Ukrainian heritage, I find your question disheartening and quite shocking. As a 2nd generation Canadian - both of my parents were born in Canada, 70+ years ago, to parents begrudgingly fleeing Ukraine after WWII due to the Soviet occupation/control of Ukraine - I find your question petulant and indicative of a lot of Americans' (and to be fair, Canadians') utter ignorance of what FREE and FAIR press is and the fallacy of ""two sides to every story"".
First of all, RT is a Russia state-owned outlet. STATE OWNED. That means they are NOT an independent and fair news source. Our democratic governments are fully within their rights to ban the information (propaganda) arm of a deemed enemy's government owned networks. Government owned is the key here. You are more than welcome to watch the Hannitys and Carlsons of the world if you want to hear ""the other side"". They've definitely been carrying Putin's water fir a while. Notice that the government is not banning Fox or AON or their ilk - they are not government owned. You know who does want to ban independent (non gov't) news outlets that are unfavorable to their view? Trump. I don't know if you're a Trump supporter or not. That's not the point of my argument. I'm pointing out that authoritarians want to control the media by outright owning networks that only tow the line, or they want to ban networks which are not laudatory. Democratic governments, on the other hand, allow a free press and when push comes to shove and it's necessary, ban government-owned propaganda outlets.

As for my ""two sides to every story"" comment. This is a fallacy that has taken root in a lot of people's minds. It's actually lazy journalism. The point of journalism is to explain what is happening, not just present facts. This means that it is the responsibility of the journalist to figure out what is correct and what is not. It means that they can give each side the opportunity to comment, but if one side presents a blatantly false account, it is the reporters OBLIGATION to explain why the statement is false. To simply relate both side's claims and leave it at that without digging into it and explaining what the real issue is, is not journalism.

Fact: Ukraine is a free and democratic country.

Fact: Ukraine is looking more and more towards the west and European integration.

Fact: Putin does not believe that an independent Ukraine should exist. The literally wrote a whole essay about this a bit over a year ago.

Fact: Russia invaded an independent neighboring country.

Fact: Russia has lied in denying every single warning claim from Ukraine and western countries about invading Ukraine since late 2021.

Fact: Russia's Foreign Minister Lavrov, in a press conference THIS WEEK - 2 weeks into the war, denied that Russia has attacked Ukraine. He literally said ""in fact, we have not attacked Ukraine"".

Fact: Putin is an autocrat/dictator.

These are all incontrovertible FACTS.

What else do you need to make a determination about which side is right?

I will add a supposition: Putin fears that a strong democracy next door, in a country that he in his heart literally does not believe should exist as an independent country, is a great threat to his grip on power in Russia.

You are free to go and search out Russian talking points if you want. They're readily available on the internet. But to ask why RT is banned? 

ARE YOU FUCKING SERIOUS?!?!?!?!?",tc6mj1

Unprovoked attacks are intolerable. Period.

And yes, I do believe that Russia intended genocide, based on its own statements. Given their past actions, it's almost to be expected.

"You're not going to see many social media posts from boots-on-the-ground russians, because they had their cellphones confiscated before they went to the front, and even if they could find a way to post actual photos or vids of the war, they would end up in prison real quick for doing it. The Ukrainians don't get sent to prison for posting truthful, current evidence of what's really going on there, and that's why you pretty much only see their side of the fight on the internet.",t9t882
[deleted],t9t882
I saw multiple interviewed POW's say that their phones were confiscated before arriving at their staging areas (e.g. Belarus). The Russian armed forces has a very anti-cell phone policy. There are photos of cell phones nailed to boards as warnings to Soldiers not to bring them to training events. The vast majority of RusFed Soldiers don't have the means for a go-pro helmet cam or similar. I'm a little surprised by the lack of Ukr. Soldier POV combat footage. Almost everything I have seen is filmed by civilians or after the fact.,t9t882

"If their phones were not confiscated, they would be under ""roaming"" mobile phone coverage (their SIM is Russian) and the local telco operation (Ukranian) will be able to locate them. Also, since cross-border financial transactions from Russia have been halted, it is unlikely they could sign up to local network data plans. LOL.",t9t882

"I mean not really, I wouldn‚Äôt expect their content in our bubble. We‚Äôre on Reddit, a western social media platform that operates in English.

"It will (for some people) create doubt.

It will also create the suggestion that it's not the Ukrainian people that will benefit, but just some evil rich corporations. And as an alternative it gives the option of not spending this money on supporting Ukraine and thereby saving ""The Economy"". And the image of the meat grinder suggests that Ukraine will not benefit anyway because of the evil corporations.

So I guess it works on two or three levels. It suggests a choice between the evil corporations and their shady motives that get the benefits (but not the Ukrainian people) and on the other hand benefiting yourself (the economy).

Additionally, college debt is crippling young people well into their late 30s. 

To put the frustration in perspective, a two-year free community college and trade school program, proposed by Obama, would only cost $9 billion per year - compared  to defense spending of $791 billion.  This alone would reduce college debt by half for future students.

Also, the Defense Department is the only branch of government that can‚Äôt pass an internal audit.  It‚Äôs wrought with waste fraud and abuse.  Simply making it accountable would facilitate subsidies to education and health.

"I'm not gonna lie this video is kinda fucked up. Why do we need a slide-show of a bunch of dead kids. I don't agree with what they're (Russians) doing at all, and Ukraine 100% has the right to fight back. I just don't think these kinds of things are good for humanity. Death is not something to make fun of.

Anyways, Slava Ukraini!!!",t94o7m
"Christ, they‚Äôre hardly out of childhood",t94o7m
Poor fucks. Fuck you Putin. None of this needed to happen.,t94o7m
"This video is in bad fucking taste; with the transition effects and music it's just stupid.

We shouldn't celebrate some mother's children being slaughtered, we don't know the real combatants from the green recruits who may have surrendered given the chance.

Maybe I'm just too sensitive. I understand the need to kill them, but imagine your son in this video. Reminds me of the videos the Taliban and ISIS made of killing troops, all stylised.",t94o7m
"Don't glorify death please. All soldiers are tools of thier government. Yes the invasion of Ukraine is terrible. And also the manipulation of the Russian people is terrible. From what we know the russian soldiers think they are doing exercises and are extremely confused (not glorifying russian invasion I condemn it). The fact of the matter is, with each human life lost is it bad regardless of our opinion of them.",t94o7m

"No sympathy. You don't go into another country with tanks and 1000s of armed men without singing up for this. Yes some are conscripts but if you aren't willing to pay consequences of getting shot up defect, move somewhere else, go dark for a period.

"IMO all these Putin about to die/in a coma/cancer are just demobilization info efforts by Kremlin. So that people wait on him to die, instead of doing something.

He is an old man sure, but he has been ""dying"" for like 8 years now.

I say put a few caps in his head just to be sure he is dead, dont trust nature.",vczo8q

for now, I just hope.",vczo8q
"The Kremlin coup and potential Putin death is all misinformation. Remember not long ago Russian operative infiltrated Raytheon in the US, exploiting Solarwinds, Microsoft, and VMware among thousands of other companies that use these software. Misinformation and cyberattacks are their only means of attack right now. Just look to the Trump Election and following campaign of how much damage misinformation can cause.",vczo8q

LMAO. Shut the fuck up Russia.,uyop7g
"But why? I though Russia had  the mightiest, manliest, machoest, strongest and most effective and modern army in the UNIVERSE, or so their propaganda said. Why then are such a superior and light years ahead of NATO armed forces, under the command of the best strategist to ever step foot on this his earth so worried about inferior, westoid weapons!?",uyop7g

It is pointless, i talked to 8 people. 
One mother, i got to talk to her, she was very friendly, open minded(for a russian), we even video called she showed me her little girl, she told me she loves to travel and she is sad now, etc.

"The best hope for Russian people to not suffer under the boots of what‚Äôs coming is a record of their arrest/imprisonment in protesting the war. 

Regardless, their quality of life will rapidly diminish on the world stage. It will be up to them if they want to continue living in that environment when consequences come. All depends on what they are hopeful for. Hard for societies to let go of contempt, though.",tvhvct

Am I guilty? A lot of people which talking about this from other countries, not wanna go for protest with me because I feel alone, no?

While its easy to say the Russian people should just get rid of Putin, we have to remember that Russia is an authoritarian regime were the opposition is sent to prison and protesters are arrested for holding blank signs. ""the Russian people"" is not an entity, there are millions of Russians with different opinions all based on the information that each has available to them.

Also, for your question, maybe there‚Äôs an online ‚ÄúYellow Pages‚Äù for Russia, or a phonebook, that would be a good place to start.",tko70u

"That'll get seized. 

Putin was ex-KGB based in East Germany

I had family in East Germany. One time they were sent toy army figures and those were seized by authorities.

Someone in Russia protesting with a blank piece of paper was arrested.

Best not to unintentionally get anyone in Russia in trouble with the secret police. Arresting someone with a blank piece of paper shows how paranoid the Kremlin is. Even if it is for a good cause of opening communication of the truth it'll just put someone in a bad situation with the authorities.",tko70u
"There was a download that copied several thousand contact informations on Russian citizens by a hacker group before it was halted. If you‚Äôd like, you may send an email or a text to a random Russian citizen (within the copied contact list) or several if you want. They have pre written a message in Russian for you and everything. I managed to get a live wire on my fourth contact (no reply on the first 3). It really works. Except the told me ‚Äú–ù–∞ —Ö—É–π –∏–¥–∏—Ç–µ –ø–∏–¥–æ—Ä—ã‚Äù which means ‚Äúfuck off faggots‚Äù.

"Another thought: if you do this, try sending to people who have a small level of power. Not the government officials or top-levels, but people who have some pull in their community. Like town officials. Or people/organizations who already gather for some kind of charity. Also students and young people, especially at universities. Maybe the press as well, tho that‚Äôs highly doubtful‚Ä¶ perhaps local small publications. Basically any individual or group who you think would consider participating in a grass roots movement.

"This is something which if you could reach them would work. I think it's really hard though.

That's why he's isolating. To control the narrative in his own country for entitlement and intimidation.

Many Russians think they're under attack due to Putin's structural censorship and manipulation propaganda of the media. They don't know what's really going on.

Reaching normal households concerns Putin and his minions Putinions maybe even more than the systematic destruction of Ukraine and the murders as a consequence.

The Russians but more his entourage keep him in place.

A coup or assassination by his entourage would be quickest. There's the option of revolt. The Chinese could stop protecting him and step up if they grow out of their governmental infancy.

The longer it takes the bigger the destruction.

This insane manipulation entitled murdering and conquering has to end. All this for the aspirations of one macho fragile ego.

The Russians outside Russia should bombard their friends and family with his lies and murders.

I hope you find a paper entrance.

I think Russian opposition seen by Putinions as resistance knows best how to print and spread these. They can be reached I guess. They have to reach the offline Russians. Remember they're also on to Putin for years. And busy with this for years but suppressed. Navalny, Kasparov and other more intellectual Russians. Many disappear.

Keep up the good work.",tko70u

"Of course you're not a monster, but your fantasy about how to end the war in Ukraine depends on the russians and their officers and political commissars holding fire while the Ukrainians and the press all marched up to their positions to chit-chat. Not going to happen, but it was a nice thought. They have no qualms murdering civilians and press, so adding them to your parley just gives them more targets to mow down. Yeah, reality sucks.",tkms2q
"Definitely not a monster, brother. But you have to see, these guys don't play by the rules you were held to. They wave white flags until they get close enough to open fire. They open fire on an unarmed old man, hands in the air, just walking by. They bomb buildings with ""children"" written on them. They open fire on humanitarian convoys. They kidnap children. They gang rape PoWs. They may just be brainwashed by an evil man, but when they get to this point, there's no saving them. They have become the evil that you say controls them. There is no redemption. There is no salvation of humanity in them. This can only be solved by blood.",tkms2q

I'm saying a prayer for you... Truly hope your life gets better.",tkms2q
"With all due respect this is probably the most naive solution I've ever read. There is no chance in a million years this would work, Chances are that they'd still all get killed and the international community would do nothing about it since the threat of nuclear war is whats stopping them from interfering. There are already war crimes and other atrocities being carried out by the Russian army but the west and NATO won't escalate a situation that can lead to the destruction of the world as we know it. 

I understand that what you've experienced with war has been horrible because that is what war is, it's horrible and cruel but not all wars are fought in vain. This is a war fought to defend people's homes, families and children. This is a war between authoritarian greed and the hope of a democratic and free eastern Europe. From the Ukrainian point if view it's not about money or oil or even ideology, it's a war for survival.",tkms2q

"I'm reminded of the Christmas truce during ww1.
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christmas_truce

The problem is that Russia has a vice grip control on the flow of information. Even if it works on a random battlefield outside kyiv, the Russians won't see it. If those troops lay down their arms and retreat, they will be shot. Russia's military is a brutal meat grinder.",tkms2q
"Thanks for sharing your thoughts. The problem I see with your solution is that Russian soldiers would have to stay put. And like you said, they fear their leaders than you, so they‚Äôll fire or get shot. 
Also, blood has been spilled and those wounds won‚Äôt heal easily. Can you picture people forgiving Russian soldiers that murdered and raped women? Would you do that? It can be done but it requires a monumental effort and emotion control.",tkms2q
"I love your positivity but, when I think of this sort of ""velvet counterattack"" all I can think about is the Christmas Truce of 1914. The front line boys may well respond to kindness and humanity....but Moscow will not. After the Christmas Truce, all the units there at the front line who met and fraternized were broken up and shipped elsewhere, replaced with new boys who had no idea of this new revelation that ""we don't really hate each other at all lol"".

So, I see this ultimately backfiring and becoming very bloody. Moscow will claim the advancing groups are terrorists and suicide bombers and whatever else, then order long range attacks by assets that can't directly see them, then send in new troops who are unaware of any of it and ordered ""shoot to kill, they're all terrorists, no prisoners.""

I want to believe in a massive gesture of goodwill, I really do, but what you're suggesting basically amounts to a large peaceful protest. The world may be receptive to those but Putin is not. It could very well make this worse.",tkms2q

"I'm an Estonian, so trust me when I say that I very much believe in the right of self-determination for small countries living next to Russia. With that out of the way, this guy was completely right. I mean, 100% spot on correct. He predicted seven years in advance what would happen, a practically unheard of accuracy in geopolitics. He even offered a constructive solution, at least in his view, of how Ukraine might avoid Russian aggression.  


But! This guy clearly does not know Russians! Their view is that everything that is in the reach of their military and is not NATO, is up for grabs as soon as they feel they're strong enough to take it. And until that point, they will blab on and on about the importance of neutral countries. It's a delay tactic only to keep NATO out until they can come in. I really hope that Sweden and Finland have had their eyes opened by the 2nd invasion of Ukraine by Russia. Russian top command are clearly morons and after 12 years when they have built up their armies again, someone might again get bad intelligence and decide that it's time to try denazifying Finland...",u1fw4r

This was seven years ago and you should watch the entire lecture or at least post the entire lecture and not a sound bite.

"I don't think he is pro Russian. I think he has valid points.

We did have Ukraine turn over Russian nukes in the 90s. We did in atleast some way offer the prospect of future admission to the EU along with NATO. Enough so that Ukraine had a dream of doing so.

In one hand, thatt dream... That prospect (however slight) scared the fuck out of Russia. They know that Nato in a conventional conflict would destroy the Russian military. Nato has also expanded many many times eastward regardless of Russian protest. It would exert further western influence on a Russian boarder for which putin did not want. 

(Let's not get into Putins delusional belief of rebuilding the former USSR's sphere of influence)

However, on the other hand it is the right of any country to ally with whoever they wish to ally with. No country (Russia, the US or China etc) should dictate whom another nation can align itself with. If Ukraine wants to join Nato, than that is their want. If they wish to join the EU, that is their want. If they wanted to join Russia, that would be their want. 

That being said, if the United States believed that Cuba was on the cusp of joining a Russian alliance, what would the states do? Once Cuba joined that Russian led alliance, Cuba becomes untouchable. So your choice is pretty bleak if you won't tolerate a neighbor joining a alliance with a adversary.

In this scenario the states would be faced with two choices (assuming diplomacy etc did not end up preventing the situation from presenting itself) :

1) tolerate Cuba joining a Russian alliance and accepting all the trimmings that come with that (based, training, weapons, exercises) regardless of American national security concerns (founded or not)

OR

2) force change in Cuba through physical means before they join the alliance

What do you think the states would do?

At the end of the day, I stand with Ukraine 10 out of 10 times. But, that does not mean we can not be critical of our own western actions leading up to this point in time. Simply questioning something as this academic is doing, is not equivalent to supporting putin.",u1fw4r
"what a stupid fuck.  tell me again why Ukraine should compromise with a dictator about how much of their land they should give up?  

why don't you fucking imagine some dictator taking a big chunk of Illinois like say Chicago.  Are you going to negotiate with them to get back some land or are you going to be fighting mad and ready to do whatever to expell them.

Ukraine is not some ‚Äúno will to fight Afghans‚Äù or a small population. It has 1/3rd of Russian population.  Capable fighting force is probably way more than Russia because regular Russians busy watching Netflix while all fighting age U‚Äôs are fighting.  In the history of war smaller armies have won wars over and over.  They have the hone advantage.  They have the NATO backing. They have all western partner countries supporting in economic needs.  Russians have limited ability just like USA had limited capacities in tackling Vietnam to Afghanistan. In the end a long war will erode Russian might.",u1fw4r

Essentially the article stated that if nuclear weapons are used,  the entire civilized world be destroyed with no winners.  There is not a single scenerio that doesn't end in total annihilation. 

Threats of actually using nuclear weapons are just threats. Deployment of them is irrelevant because the range of missiles has expanded to the point where they can go about as far as needed to reach their targets.",u45n2p
"OK Vlad, you can't even pull off a conventional war.",u45n2p
"It wont change peoples minds about joining or not russia has always been a threat to both finland and sweden,we just figured he was happy being an asshole inside his country.

but clearly russia has decayed into a rouge unstable state so nato is on the table out of survival self preservation.

at this point it doesnt really matter what putin says we have watched what he did very close to our contries and its a system propping this up not just a single man.

if putin uses nukes we have world war 3,im sure putin wouldnt mind nuking someone but hopefully someone around him doesnt want to die and puts a bullet in his old senile brain before a launch is made.

as much as putin wants to be an isolated psychopath island of power everyone around him has children wives and loved ones they would all burn to dust if they let him launch.

"If I remember correctly a majority of the worlds nuclear arsenal is not based on missiles - they are mostly delivered via bomber planes. 

With that in mind, Russia doesn‚Äôt really have a chance at winning a nuclear war. NATO has much better air defense systems, missile defense systems, better bombers, better fighters to escort/intercept bombers, better means of production, better supply chain, etc.

I am not sure how that is possible as they can just sprung up some time later, but no one wants to think about that. The popular opinion is that Azov = Nazi, all of them, every single one. Nazi = bad. So as long as there is a single Azov fighter shooting at Russians, they won't stop. They don't consider regular Ukrainian Army to be a problem, but Azov has to cease to exist. There are other similar national battalions such as Aidar that are full of Nazis as per average Russian citizen.

"I hate to shit in your cheerios, but that is exactly how that mortar is supposed to work.

Not all mortars have a fixed firing pin that is activated by dropping the round on it. This one is activated by pulling that cord to release the firing mechanism and trigger the round. The soldiers are covering their ears in case there is an accidental detonation, but after that he is looking at the sight and checking the alignment, not checking to see what happened with the round.

If you want to see an example of another mortar that works this way, go to YouTube an search for French 120mm mortar. That should get you some videos of a NATO system that also doesn't fire when you drop a round down the tube. It is a slightly slower way of operating, but it can be more accurate because you can check the sighting after loading the round.",uo7zn0
"That may look like a fail, but it's not. Those large mortar can be fire that way on purpose. Dropping the shell does not set it off (they take cover in case it does because of a malfunction). Once the shell is in place and safe, the mortar is adjusted, then fire using the pin connected to a rope. I'm guessing this is a little bit safer for the loader and more precise (but slower).Check the French and US troops doing both approach (on youtube .com /watch?v=-0-zfSkWqZE)",uo7zn0

"My question to anyone who is in favor of the no-fly zone.

How is the no-fly zone going to be enforced? The answer is NATO must be willing to shoot down Russian planes.

How about the air defenses along the Russian and Belarusian border that covers parts of Ukrain where the no-fly zone is going to be implemented? Surely they will have to be destroyed first before NATO can fly their jets over the no-fly zone.

What does this mean, ladies and gents? DIRECT CONFRONTATION between the biggest nuclear states. It will spill out of control and guarantees World War 3.

There is a reason why until now the West has rejected a no-fly zone. This view has been shared by politicians and military strategists in the West.

I say keep the flow of weapons to Ukraine and assist them in other means.",tflrfb
"I know that arguments against a no fly zone, and I‚Äôm not even advocating for one. I guess my question is‚Ä¶How long will the world be able to watch innocent men, women, and children be slaughtered before there‚Äôs a tipping point? I don‚Äôt want a war, but don‚Äôt we eventually have to take a stand?",tflrfb
when are people going to realize that a no fly zone will result in war between NATO and Russia? put your emotions to the side for one minute and think.,tflrfb
"In addition to starting WWIII, it seems like it wouldn‚Äôt actually change the reality in the ground. A lot of the munitions killing civilians are being fired from the ground. So with a no-fly zone not only would the cities and people keep being attacked, but we would also add an additional level of complexity by escalating to direct confrontation between nuclear states. That‚Äôs a possibility of armageddon and the end of most life on Earth, not just WWIII. Albert Einstein said he didn‚Äôt know with what weapons WWIII would be fought, but WW4 would be sticks and stones. Or something like that. Too lazy to look up the verbatim quote, but that‚Äôs the jist of it.",tflrfb
"Since most of this destruction is being done by ground based missiles and artillery, closing the skies won‚Äôt prevent them",tflrfb
"I‚Äôm sitting on a caf√© before work bawling my eyes out because of this. You have no idea what a beautiful and welcoming land Ukraine is. I only visited briefly in my early 20s, but it made a lasting impression.",tflrfb
"That will never happen unless the US and NATO are already in a direct military conflict. At that point it doesn‚Äôt matter, but before that a no fly zone will definitely lead to that escalation",tflrfb

"On April 1st Russia will sign up another 130,000 conscripts in their military. As long as these young men willing go and their parents willingly send them, then we can blame the Russian people.",tagcha
"I agree with this.  Recent polls show that they are in support of this war.
Volunteer fighters have joined Ukraine from all over the world.
Most recently, Belarus had over 300 people join the Ukraine side.

The people following orders and blindly following also have to carry some responsibility.

After all, it takes a lot more than a few people to do this.",tagcha
What is this sub for exactly?,tagcha
Fuck them if you follow Slavic history Russia always had shity leaders and the always send there solders to murder Ukrainian people like Stalin did in the 30s killed 8 million Ukrainians by starvation at this point it‚Äôs there fault for allowing themselves to be ruled by dictators,tagcha
"whenever I hear about pity for the Russian people, it reminds me I need to contact my representatives and see what they are doing to further fuck up russias economy.",tagcha
I've not seen much if any Russians posting on this sub...,tagcha

"Yeah, they are stupid. It would've been a lot quicker to do it the US way(after, of course, getting all the civils safe) and just fucking erase everything like they do it usually. Probably he doesn't have the money to rebuild it after.",tagcha
Russia is a self-destructive organism and the poison fangs it stabs itself with are the leaders.   Such beautiful and brilliant people but with Gulag proclivities.,tagcha
Yes it‚Äôs difficult when they defend there shity history it‚Äôs like if the descendent of slave owners tried to justify there ancestors.,tagcha
It‚Äôs when we give too much power to the state that tyranny shows it‚Äôs ugly head. People give up power for security and then get nether when there master treats them like a serf.

"Funny how an advanced nation like china takes so much care to carefully sculpt every bit of narrative because they are so afraid of their own people but little old putin is the god emperor of russia and can banish a rebellion with the click of a mouse.  Absolute bullshit, he has the support of his people, the majority has fully bought in.",tagcha
Why you blaming the people when they have little to do with it?,tagcha
"This feels like gatekeeping. I'm American but I don't see why someone who is directly affected by their own countries actions can't talk.  


I mean, it's just as counterproductive if you tell white people they can't discuss BLM or if you tell men they can't discuss #meToo. There are a lot of people in Russia and their lives have been affected greatly by the man who started this war.",tagcha
when did reddit not become a 'worldwide' thing? who gets to censor who? you approves 'approved for viewing' content in your little world where dialog is 'evil'?,tagcha
It is important to note that many Russians don‚Äôt support the war and don‚Äôt support Putin. Many are actually leaving Russia because of fear or reprisal and because the economy is fucked.

Especially little children who just born in Russia, probably they blindly following putins regime, or those who getting tortured in police departments, yeah they also blindly following the regime, or navalny, Yeah he is putins puppet tbh. Or me a 21 year old dude who just want to live peacefully without any trouble. Yeah fuck me also. No pity for us. We all are war criminals. YEEES. If 1 commited a crime, everyone who had any relation with him must be punished too. GJ MAN. #FUCKRUSSIANS.",tagcha
"I know people will say it's not the Russian populations fault, but the bottom line is that if Russia isn't responsible for Russia no-one is. 

at some point the burden lies on the people to fix their problems and their government by whatever means.",tagcha
"Despite being called a Russian Troll I am not Russian but western, I am however anti American and concerned how much notice the world has taken of this war while it ignores all the other conflicts going on around the globe, Everyone cries warcrimes at every little thing while ignoring the plight of people the Yemeni's who suffer worse than Ukraine every day, but no one seems to care because it's western bombs falling from western planes flown by the evil Saudi's that kill little children daily",tagcha
"If Zelenskyy care so much about innocent Ukrainian people not dying, why don't he just back out of the plan of joining NATO then? That's pretty much all he got to do to stop Russia from attacking.",tagcha

Are you saying occupying Ukraine is the healthiest of the two options?,ttmru0
"""retreat"" Oh did you mean redeploying to Donbass to fight the remaining 60k of Ukrainian reserves?  
It's not their objective to take Kiev aswell.",ttmru0

"You answered your own question here. Low GDP but large army. Not high quality but a large quantity does not produce winners. 
As seen in this sub, even with all of the Russian propaganda, civilian Russians are protesting the war, there‚Äôs not enough supplies for their army so they‚Äôre demoralized, and troops are learning they‚Äôre being lied to so they‚Äôre surrendering or abandoning their posts.",t51h4x
Ukraine is fiercely defending their homeland like Russia defended when Nazis invaded 79 years ago at Stalingrad.,t51h4x

"yah no Ukraine will not win combat. Russia will back down. if Russia commits, Ukraine doesn't stand a chance",t51h4x
"also you have to realize we aren't being shown the extent of Ukrainian losses. Ukrainians also can't afford the same losses that Russia can. when they start sending in the good stuff, it will get worse for Ukrainians",t51h4x

"No, i'm not concerned. Russia pays huge price for very small pieces of land that they takes in weeks or months. Also, it almost cannot use artillery due to the lack (or should i say ABSENCE) of ammunition depots recently, and without artillery they cannot fight properly. Also, one million mobilized troops will soon liberate the south.",vvymjw
"40 square km in 5 months, while actually LOSING at least half their ground fighting force and equipment, and ground in the north and south.  
Russia could take everything to the Dnieper by the end of the year and they'd still be in a position to lose.",vvymjw
Wars are this state are about will. Afganistan was occupied whole for 20 years and they fought it back within a month.,vvymjw
"What have you been smoking? The orcs are, acording to themselves, pausing/resting.

UAF in the mean time is obliterating their supply depos, comand centras and logistic hubs (source the pro-orc Girkin) aswell as destroyong decent amounts of armor.",vvymjw
"I am not concerned, in battle this is called a ‚Äúfalse retreat‚Äù which means that you are purposely spreading the enemy line thinner by letting them advance into ambushes. Also, lets not forget ukraine has a possibly army of 6-12 million conscripts out of a population of 44 million pre war. Zelenskyy just ordered 1 million men to take back the entire south. They are doing great!!!!",vvymjw
"So does Russia, what's your point?",vvymjw
"The land lease act is just getting ramped up. It only takes one long-range HIMAR to be employed for all of occupied Ukraine to be within reach. Russia is not demonstrating they have strong resources to sustain this war. Instead, they are taking a 'breather'.                                                                                                                                                     Now will it be easy to wrestle away all that stolen land? That will be tough, but they could be near a tipping point to get major gains.",vvymjw
"It is concerning, but this is a long term war. And Russia is losing the advantage of artillery (read the news about himars and other western howitzers). We should be worried but it should be just an incentive to donate more, buy Ukrainian products and try to reduce our energy consumption!",vvymjw
Germany takes a lot in 1939+. So? Does  it helps in the end?,vvymjw

"Russia is telling lies by making accusations so they can justify their actions. If it's true that the Russia is now accusing Ukraine of trying to make a dirty bomb, it means Putin is trying to justify dropping a tactical nuke on Kyiv. He is also goading the west. He also wants to destroy the west. I hope the world can see this narcissistic behavior",t7vau4

"NATO no fly zone over Ukraine 

Direct Nato involvement in Ukraine (so basically the above)

Putin attacking a NATO state and probably Finnland and Sweden too even though they currently aren't Nato states .- but an escalation in that direction from Russia will be WW3


Problem is:
Now Putin says Ukraine has a ""dirty nuke"", which they haven't. Also Ukraine gave back all nukes to Russia in exchange for a promise they wouldn't be attacked by Russia - didn't age well...

So now Putin is looking for reason to nuclear strike the Ukraine as he claims ""they have a dirty bomb"", where would he strike? - probably not a major city as he can't rule a country which he obliterated.
It's all about showing his power and make Ukraine surrender, so the smallest nuke somewhere as less inhabitants as possible is enough for that.

But what will happen if a nuclear silo opens and a rocket leaves the silo and flies west in the direction of Nato states? - after Ukraine it isn't far to the NATO - all hell will brake loos as there isn't much time to calculate where it will impact and make a decision

Best case:
US anti rocket system will shoot the the nuke down - just in case - and no nuclear detonation will take place

But then what? - for Putin it will be direct Nato involvement and we are back at the topic of this post...


In that case we can only hope the chain of commands within Russia goes ""fuck you Putin we are no lunatics"" and just don't start the rocket and overcome Putin - but how lucky can we be?",t7vau4

Putin will know this so the only way to win a nuclear war is to be the first who destroys everything. So if he wanna drop a nuke it‚Äôs not like this it would be a massiv attack around the world. Every country with rockets reach‚Äôs Russia get vaporized. Germany, Poland, Turkey, United Kingdom, France, up to the U.S. This is not 1945, literally a intercontinental rocket fully loaded with atomic-heads destroys a area auf round a bout 65.000sq km so this means massive areas are just living hell.",t7vau4

Part of this can be considered a failing by the west. There is a great lecture on this by the University of Chicago on this that breaks this down.

He also says that humanitarian corridors are being made so ordinary citizens can leave and not suffer from political conflict. But Ukrainian soldiers (or local nazi organisations) prevent people from leaving and use them is a human shield,t75tfn

"watching Putin interact on his last trip to Iran, I can deduce his suit jacket is padded, so I assume he has soft armor built into the lining probably level 3A which is rated to stop most handgun threats. If he's concerned about staying alive, I read a few months ago there was a fifth attempt on his life, then I find it hard to fathom he would destroy this world. He has accumulated considerable wealth, he also has children, things he won't be able to enjoy if a nuclear holocaust is unleashed. He did threaten Finland and Sweden and nothing came of it, he threatened the USA and the Western coalition plus Australia with grave consequences and nothing came of it. However who knows what a madman is capable of.

Having watched carefully for 160+ days now, I have NEVER seen a Russian 'soldier' stop (or return) to render aid to anyone... They just run. On reflection, you can't call them soldiers and I for one wouldn't serve with anyone that bad.",wngn4b
You orcs are gonna need them... Or you could just go home and stop trying to take a country that doesn't belong to you and stop murdering people for your master's sense of pride.,wngn4b

Elastic bands from 50s. Nice,wngn4b
I like how at the end it shows you how to crawl over your dead and dieing comrades after you fucked up the tourniquet.,wngn4b
These do not apply nearly enough pressure if applied by someone in a weakened state. They also slip loose when moving around. This could literally point towards why so many wounded russians die compared to wounded ukrainians.,wngn4b

Maybe before you invaded UA, you could of given your staff the kit and training beforehand? Its incomprehensible to me how you are so aggressive and so disrespectful of your own people...

Oh I forgot, the Russian elite use Russian money not on the improvements for everyone in Russia, but just to buy luxury homes and yachts abroad for them selves. Because its shit living in Russia.

 As for the soldiers who got conscripted, due to previous history around the relationships, with the USSR countries, who still think they are USSR ,they still collude. I bet the leaders of theses countries got rich, but very little monies arrived to improve lives to the people in these many countries...",wngn4b

" I know, tourniquets are tourniquets and they are nothing special, but USSR made the same exact ones, even the color is the same. Nothing has changed since then in russia, nothing goes forwards.",wngn4b
A rubber tourniquet?  There's no way that would have worked on some wounds I saw overseas.  The point where the stick breaks off the nylon cat tourniquet.  Or when the person has to have more than one put on them.   There's NO WAY I'd trust a rubber tourny.,wngn4b
Why this shoud matter? And if Russians learn something in theory they can't use in practice,wngn4b
Ahhhhh so this is what an elite fighting force looks like. I wonder how they‚Äôd fare going up against some US marines,wngn4b
"These guys do not seem so afraid of death, perhaps because they‚Äôre young and this is the first war they‚Äôd be in. They seem to be having a laugh at such a situation you need to be serious and focused. Just more lambs to the slaughter‚Ä¶. 

It really is also a trap making it seem professional and needed when really there‚Äôs been reports of Russian officers shooting the injured or leaving them.",wngn4b

"The harsh reality of this war shows that Russia was never even close to being a super power. They're a regional power, with influence to exert on its neighbours. 

They scared the rest of the world with threats to think that they are a super power. This war has slumped Russia into what is now a corrupt barely functioning kleptocracy that just happens to own world ending weaponry.",xcbbth
"Corruption in russia is at such a shitty level that 60-70% of military budget went into corrupt officials pockets.Also, ukraine isn‚Äôt small at all, by any standards. Yes it is smaller than russia, but it is not small, plus, they have a pretty large population. Ukraine also mobilised and trained almost 1,000,000 reserves (900,000 to be more precise) this is not a number to be joked with. 
Couple of other point are:
- it‚Äôs much harder to invade rather than defend(defenders already have positions, they know the land well, logistics is easier for them) 
- morale in the ukrainian soldiers is 100x higher because they‚Äôre literally defending their home and people, plus, ukrainians are very united at the moment
- ukrain has received new, well maintained equipment. Whereas, we‚Äôve seen the state russian equipment is.

All in all, at a first glance it seems like ukraine should be losing, but if you think about it, it‚Äôs not surprising at all that they‚Äôre destroying the orcs",xcbbth
"The Soviet Union was a super power.

The Russian Federation has the GDP of the state of Florida most of which has been systematically stolen for years. 

This isn't a battle between the USSR and Ukraine. This is Florida Man trying to fuck an alligator.",xcbbth

"Soviet Union was a superpower, Russia is not.",xcbbth
Because they're not a super power.,xcbbth
Id also add that i dont think Russia have ever been the ‚Äúworlds second army‚Äù at any point. It just made itself look stronger than it really was.,xcbbth
"Evidently yes, especially when you consider these factors;

- Ukraine is by no means small, it‚Äôs the largest country in Europe.
- Up until 2014 Ukraine military was in shambles, this changed once Russia attacked and we‚Äôve been building up our military ever since with the explicit reason of being able to take on Russia.
- Russian military has always been a paper tiger.",xcbbth
"do you think this is just a joke and russia didnt use everything they got to kill us?

they trying EVERYTHING they can

but they are fake state, corruption for 20+ years, when your leader didnt know his sallary, but building a hidden palace at Gelengik

all you need in russia is splitt budget for your own favore, they all do so

this is result",xcbbth
"And this isn‚Äôt the first time Russia oversold their ability. The russo-japanese war was a mess. And the Soviet Union had a really hard time in the winter war against Finland 1939-40. Officially the Soviet Union won but they only managed to occupy small parts of the country, not do the complete regime change they planned. My theory: when you spend all your time listening to propaganda and persecute historians who try to find the truth you end up not learning from old mistakes. Seriously I‚Äôve felt this past half year so many times like I‚Äôm watching a rerun from previous wars, they‚Äôre just doing what they always do.",xcbbth
"""""Russia had an Army""""",xcbbth
"# The Iron Curtain is now the Iron-Oxide Curtain

Russia made the fatal mistake of believing their own hype. They built the biggest conventional war force in the history of mankind‚Ä¶ 70 years ago. 

However, Russia is not and has never been a truly free society. Therefore, it is illegal -and dangerous- to question the state and its assertions. 

Without the self-criticism and constant reevaluation, Russia never got better. In fact, they got worse as their equipment and tactics aged, and their leadership and martial studies atrophied.

Russia is a 3rd world country with nukes. They have failed miserably to meet their possibilities, and instead have exposed themselves as a bunch of big dumb thugs who got caught when called out by a smaller nation who wants no part of their cancerous culture.",xcbbth

The secret ingredient is... corruption,xcbbth
"super power - it's their made up fantasy. a brainwash soap-bubble.

in reality - everything is ""limping a leg"". from top to bottom. everyone steals and lies from/to the next in command. from basic peasants to the top politicians.

dictators just keep their people poor - so they don't have time to stand agains government. poor people are also a cheap meat to be sent to war. most do it by their free will to earn some money - to buy food.

then when it's time to really show your power - you will discover that one tank can only move, one can only shoot. third is simply stationary due to fact that someone has stolen/sold the diesel from it.

in short. it's just a mess - covered up in lies and false hopes.",xcbbth
"The Russian military is both oversold and corrupt. They flash high end weapons, but can't afford to actually field them much less sustain them (Google the Armata tank).

 The money that does go to the military is usually siphoned off / stolen at every level, resulting in poorly maintained equipment. 

The real thing they have is nuclear weapons and the willingness to use them. Unlike the United States, Russia will use tactical nuclear weapons as part of their doctrine. Escalate to de-escalate. They know we won't respond in kind. This is actually the scary part- how will Putin respond if the Ukrainian ass kicking continues? Remember, he can't afford to lose.",xcbbth
God is not in the side of Russia Armed Terrorists.,xcbbth
"The biggest problem is not the equipment. It may be old and rusty, but so is much of Ukraine's equipment. The greatest weakness of any authoritarian country is the centralization of all decisions. This leads to orders not being taken directly at the front but by ill-informed generals and commanders. As a result, troops on the ground wait forever for fire support because they cannot communicate directly with other troops.

In the Ukrainian army, front-line commanders can make lightning-quick decisions and thus exploit weaknesses. We saw that impressively in Charkiw

This centralization of decisions is necessary because otherwise the army would become too great a danger for those in power.

In Russia's case, there is also the fact that Russia's appearance is more important than its true strength. 

Well-trained and motivated soldiers can also turn T-62s into deadly weapons. Then there is corruption. In the Russian army, everyone gets rich. From the general to the soldier. This may be ""ok"" in times of peace because it makes the troops happy, but in wartime it only becomes apparent what a desolate army you have.

Russia is not a superpower in the conventional sense",xcbbth

"Ukraine isn't small, especially by European standards.  Ukraine has a national identity, wouldn't you fight to keep that?  Russian soldiers were given false excuses to fight, most weren't told about the war until they were crossing the border, none of them are willing to die fighting Ukraine, hence the running and surrendering.  An artillery shell can take out a car, not a country.  It takes several missiles to fully demolish a building.  There isn't enough arsenal to completely destroy Ukraine and they didn't prepare their military to fight well.  Finally, Russians are not a professional Army.  You know this because of the looting, rapes, and executions--incredibly bad performance.  Thugs can bully a town, but not the professional fighting (western) force Ukraine has been training since 2014.  The discipline and sacrifice needed doesn't exist with the Russian soldiers--they are not there because they truly believe their own homeland is at stake, they don't know why they're there; so they fuck around.",xcbbth

"Not  so simple as to anwser they are shit. That just stupid anwser. Lets  take moskva pride of the navy. I recently watched video about what happend to her. It had state of the art aa defence. But if info is corect it was plagued by problem that could be solved with maintainance. So it had almost no active air defence. You can take that info and compare it to their army. I read somewhere that russia  had big plans with modernization all that flashy propaganda you saw but only 10% was really modernized and capable. Most of that you saw in invasion force. But lacking of good plans and false hope that ukraine will just give up cost them heavy losses that first month. I wouldnt say that their first forces to invade were incompetent or bad really the oposite but their own plans defeated them more than UAF.


This conflict only brought out sad state of the russian army but dont underestimate them they can still pack a punch

"You can have the best equipment that money can buy and still lose against a rabble if you have idiots in command and the military is basically a trash bin. Vietnam won against America (Sorry but this is so obvious that I need to use it) even though they had worse military. What matters is something bigger than just pure numbers. It's the resolve,culture, goals, help from locals and many more.

I will give you some pointers though what are the problems of their military.

The first problem and the biggest is Russian Kleptocratic form of living. It's normal and accepted for people to steal, accept bribes etc. this is bad for almost everything. It shows in the military also. They steal instead of making their postions harder to take. Also I heard that many positions in military can be bought like a candy. That's why you have so many incompetent people in the military.  

The second problem is that Russians didn't know that they are going to war.  At least that's what I think happened. They were lied that this is only a training and then Putin send them to war. That's stupid move on so many levels that I don't know where to start.

The next problem is military.  In most countries serving in the military is mostly not influenced by your living conditions. In Russia though it's almost the exact opposite.  Most people are there to gain money because that's the only way for them to make living.

The next is not mine but by military experts. Russia uses something called ""push"" military supplies doctrine while NATO uses ""pull"". What that means in short is that Russia pushes the exact same supplies even when they are not needed and NATO doctrine sends supplies requested. Both have they downsides but it seems that Russian doctrine is worse. 

Those are the first ones that you need to solve but the Kleptocracy will take generations to eradicate. 

Russia was super power but during the USSR era. I was thinking that they were strong (not super power though) before the war but that was just an illusion which they created.",xcbbth

But when they face and confront the free world, they crumble quickly, because they aren't as the same level.

"They gave them 8 years to prepare between annexing Crimea and the full invasion. All while propping up little uprisings to make sure Ukraine had the maximum possible number of combat experienced personnel.

"It had a the basis of a very good Military but whilel Putin claimed to have modernised it much of this modernisation was patchy and did not apply as a whole system leaving parts of it neglected. the advances in Military technologies and weapons also need to be reflected in the doctrine and methods of its employment. For example the West has invested hugely in communication and surveillance integration while Russia has thrown money into ambitious single projects leaving a huge gap between them and what they can actually employ in combat. Things like night vision, body armour and optical weapon sights are standard in Western Infantry units whilst only available to limited special troops in the Russian Army. The standard of education in NATO and Western soldiers means that tactics and decisions are decided at a lower level so they can react quicker while the Russian command structure is left over from the Soviet cold war model with all decisions made by senior officers. While Western armies have spent time studying the weaknesses of their possible enemies the Russian army seems to ignore any important advancements in its adversaries. There is all this and on top corruption. Corruption is endemic in the Russian Military. It affects almost everything in it. Not just theft and funding but the appointments of command and responsibility being based on loyalty to government or oligarchs rather than professional merit. Lastly there is experience. The Russian Military has not tried a large scale combined arms operation before and this is heavily dependant on exactly the things I have mentioned first.

"To answer this adequately would take a whole PhD thesis. But I'd start with questioning the assumptions you make in your question. Is Russia actually a superpower? Is Ukraine a ""small nation""? I'd suggest no to both of those points, and then on your final question, does Russia have a good military - also no. But a lot more can be written about all these things, covering everything from corruption, outdated military doctrine/tactics, arrogant assumptions made by the leadership, poor planning, fear of passing on bad news up the chain of command leading to incorrect reporting, huge impact of NATO weapons and tactics, NATO intelligence support, poor morale and discipline among Russian troops even from the outset vs. extremely high motivation and determination of Ukrainian forces to defend their land against invaders, etc. etc. There are just so many things that could be said here, and none of them are in Russia's favor.",xcbbth

There is really a quite complex set of parts to this answer but to simplify - by being a kleptocracy that functions to syphon wealth to a criminal elite through a functioning network of organised criminal institutions.

"Once upon a time, in the era of empires; one of them was ruled by a tsar and his family; his subjects were generally poor, uneducated peasants, slave-alike serfs; it was a feudal state. In theory the serfdom was abolished around 1861; in practice, everyday life of common peasants changed not much. The beginning of industrialization; the rise of the ""working class"". At some point the tsar made some mistakes, which allowed the opportunists to take over the power.  As proved by other empire (see the Chinese), it was not a significant change in mentality and everyday life; just a change of the rulers, not of rules.  The ambitions were even bigger; Europe was going to be invaded. Poland to be erased. Coalition with Nazis. Coalition break. The empire needed help. At a huge human price, but also with a huge influx of armament and technology from US/UK, the empire won. They liked it. They kept the ""liberated"" territories. They also kept the tech, both what they received as help and the tech of the looser part, as war trophy. And they started to build the industry. Successfully, quite. But did the mentality changed? Not much. They needed another proof they are bigger and better. And another one. They ""helped"" around some local wars. Manchuria. Korea. Hungary. Czechs. Syria. Algeria. Egypt. And so on. Culminating with Afgan war. Which was just too much. The economy could not sustain these. What once was advanced tech, it lagged behind the  innovations of the more liberal world.

The other thing is that the Russians spend a lot of their budget on r&d, maintaining their blue water navy, their massive submarine fleet, and their nuclear arsenal.

"Much of what was always feared are sheer numbers. The other side of that argument is whether those numbers represent true capability. Many of the armored trucks, IFV‚Äôs APC‚Äôs etc‚Ä¶ coming out of storage showed a lack of investment in their maintenance and therefore weren‚Äôt combat viable. 

The biggest mistake was not realizing that hundreds if not thousands of pieces of armored capability was influxed into Europe over the pat twenty years due to the war in Afghanistan. So much of it was going be idled and instead it went to Ukraine. Modern armored capabilities means a lot. Look at what is happening to Russian vehicles.

You can swap USA/Vietnam Russia/Ukraine for many other situations in history",xcbbth
"I think most people are misunderstanding the situation quite a bit. Russia's ""special operation"" is not a total war mobilisation. Huge difference in military approach and critical exercise of resources.
- Ukraine's survival is hedged on  the total mobilisation of resources and western support. Survival is at stake without one of these; reference military capabilities of Ukraine prior to Feb 2022 and the total war transformation of military capabilities in the last 7mos.
- Russia's military capabilities are absolutely devastating if total war conditions were present.
- Russia's military is absolute crap compared to western standards, wrt technological aptitude and use of modern technologies. Western dilemma has always been: fewer soldiers and higher technology embedded in military abilities due to the political and economical perspective of large standing armies. Meanwhile Russia has not had the military aptitude of technology advancement as western armies have because of heavy reliance on large manpower and large non-automated equipment. Think of it this way: men with guns are cheap; robots and lasers are expensive. You have to spend money to research, develop, test, integrate, and apply technology in military applications. When you are highly corrupt, you highly suck at it.
- which brings us back to Russia performing like this is definitely an eye opener but not so much unexpected. I think in the beginning most military advisors were cautious because they were not sure about the amount of manpower and equipment that Russia was willing to throw at this operation. If Russia decides to overrun Ukraine, they have the ability to do so and to conduct scorched earth all the way to some western capital. Of course, suicidal but nevertheless very doable.
- which leads me to why Ukraine victory is almost sure: this conflict/war is the wet dream come true to all western military contractors and they are willing, and happy to, expend resources to get their gear tested in real time with an adversary that is seen geopolitically and economically challenging. All Ukrainians need to do is continuously be the universal soldier of the future guinea pig and they will become the future trainers for ground combat for all western countries. The amount of data with military technology here is invaluable; as shitty as that sounds because of utter damage to a whole nation and countless lives lost.
- question right now is, if Russia decides total war applies after this Ukrainian counteroffensive, how do western military doctrines apply and counter that heavy manpower?",xcbbth

"No, they don't have good military which is now obvious.   ""Superpower"", among other things such as economics and strategic considerations of risk of direct attack, implies you can project strength (military strength) globally, on short notice even, not just attack your land neighbors, and have the logistics to sustain that.   Russia certainly lacks that capability, and honestly I can't think of any other country aside from the US that meets that criteria, currently.",xcbbth
"One word. CORRUPTION within military high level rank and file.

Furthermore, Ukraine has the benefit of some guidance from UK/ American special services and military command. Some of the best trained military minds on the planet.",xcbbth
Short answer corruption and No.,xcbbth
"Russia is not a superpower. And even actual superpowers have trouble winning imperialist wars, like Vietnam for the US and Afghanistan for the USSR.",xcbbth
"Corruption, this war uncovered the filth behind the gold veil. Its a reason why despite having many natural resources & GDP to be a member of the G20, Mexico is largely underdeveloped & run by non-gov groups (cartels).",xcbbth
"It was all Facade. Russia is rotting away from within for decades now.

They only have their Nukes. And those are very expensive to maintain. If you see the current state of their rotten Nation... i wonder in what state are those Nukes?

And i wonder how much that is a Security Problem for the whole rest of world?",xcbbth
Superpower lol more like a failed state.,xcbbth
"A few reasons. 

Rampant corruption means no fuel to move trucks so tyres rot and burst. Super advanced radios bought and paid for are cheap chinese shit from the 90's etc. Advanced drones are a DSLR with wings. 

Combine that with the Dictator effect, where people will lie to advance through the ranks as it's not a meritocracy, so issues get left unreported and unfixed, and you have an army with, for instance, the advanced SU57 fighter... but only like 10 of them. They have upgrade programs for older planes... but only 8 have been upgraded etc. 

The rich were making a killing in Russia long before the Ukrainians got involved - they never thought they'd actually need their military so lied about it etc. So when it came to use it, they found out just how much of a paper tiger it was. 

Then you have Ukraine - a nation who has been at war for 8 years and *rapidly* modernised its armed forces. It strengthened its officer core, it trained, it got better kit etc. So when it came to the very chaotic defense of Kyiv, where units from all manner of forces such as marines, border guard, national guard, and secret service came together in chaos to defend - they could. Because they had well trained officers, and defending is easier. 

Meanwhile Russians are still taught a doctrine showing it's age in WW2 letalone now. Because you don't need to spend money upgrading your doctrine if all you do is parade.",xcbbth
No Russia does not have a good military,xcbbth
"‚ÄúA small nation like Ukraine‚Äù

Its not Russia, its how the world underestimated Ukrainians and their courage and will to fight.",xcbbth
"The war is not with Ukraine, it is a proxy war with Nato where Nato is using Ukraine‚Äôs manpower, most advanced western arms, most advanced intelligence, western training, thousands of foreign military advisers, trainers and specialists, etc. Pentagon and CIA are working full time to provide planning and intelligence. Russia terribly underestimated the western support and own military capabilities.",xcbbth
Corruption.,xcbbth
Never was or will be a superpower all smoke and mirrors.,xcbbth
"They haven‚Äôt had a good military since their invasion of Afghanistan. All they‚Äôve done since then is beat up former-Soviet countries, and help a dictator against insurgents. Russia really has no reputation from the last 30 years considering they got their shit kicked in during the first Chechen war and second didn‚Äôt end the insurgency in the Caucasus, they weren‚Äôt even against an actual conventional military.

The reverence to Russian strength is mostly from boomers who grew up during the Cold War and fail to realize the USSR was like 15 republics combined, not just one largely empty shithole that can‚Äôt even give its soldiers electricity in their barracks.

No Russian leader has been able to honestly call themselves part of a superpower since 91.",xcbbth
"No it doesn‚Äôt . And your average Russians would probably like to be at home drinking vodka, eating McDonalds and watching Netflix, rather than waging war on one of its neighbours.",xcbbth
"This is a prime example of propaganda working, literally western media, news anchors, generals (and other army officials) were literally singing to russias tune, take a moment to remind yourself, 48 hours and ukraine is gone, 3 days, 4 days etc.  (MY SELF included!) 

Guess what, we all fell for their shit. and what is worse (or in our case good), putin himself fell for it.",xcbbth
Because they‚Äôre stupid and they have all their money to putin and his friends and didn‚Äôt invest in their military or education systems just plain ol dumb nazis,xcbbth
"Think about this: who ever proved to you that Russia was a super-power?

Those who know generally describe it as a conglomeration of a number of mafia-like families with the facade that it has a ruling government.",xcbbth
Your first mistake is thinking the russian federation is a superpower. The USSR was. the russians just thought they inherited the mantle. Basically a 3rd world nation with nukes.,xcbbth

"ukraine is huge, biggest country in europe... its not a small nation",xcbbth
"Is that you, captain obvious?",xcbbth
Russian incompetence plus Ukrainians' will to fight.,xcbbth
"If Ukraine wasn't getting a constant influx of Western weaponry, Intel and money, than the war would be all Russia.",xcbbth
"Corruption

A effective dictatorship

A country/federation run by a mad person

A disregard for the truth",xcbbth
"Even the US has historically had massive trouble against ‚Äúsmall nations.‚Äù It turns out ‚Äúgreat patriotic wars to resist a foreign aggressor‚Äù are super hard to win for the offensive side, even for the strongest nations.",xcbbth
"The key point is that for an army to work well it needs to be prepared, well equipped, trained, well supplied and also the men need to adhere to the fight.
Moral and motivation matters in all cases where human have to perform.

Russia was not prepared, badly equipped, not supplied and the soldiers don‚Äôt want to fight

This explains the lacklustre performance of the war at the start.
That said let a not make the mistake to think Ukraine has won‚Ä¶ the most likely scenario is entranchement behind the river and a very rude winter where Russia will systematically destroy civilian infrastructure in Ukraine with missiles and let the winter makes its miracle like it had in the last 400 years of Russian history",xcbbth
"Occasionally countries with large army capacity go to war against one another but in the modern age any army with such capacity has nuclear weapons and a large population therefore unless it‚Äôs entirely necessary the extreme expense of moving to a war economy isn‚Äôt worth it if you can achieve your goals over time and win through attrition eg the u.s using only 100,000 men in Afghanistan despite having a standing army of approximately 2 million",xcbbth
"Russia is NOT a superpower, the United States is currently the sole superpower of the world with china in second but not there yet. Russia is a regional power at best, or at least they were before Ukraine put a boot up their ass.",xcbbth
"1- They underestimated the ukrainian combativity by A LOT

2- They underestimated NATO ability to economically sanctions them

3- They underestimated the amount of weapons deliveries from the west

4- They did a fuck ton of errors, their invasion was very poorly planned, for example instead of bombing ukrainian military bases, ukrainian government, electricity/communication structures before crossing the border, they wasted countless of missiles on civilians

5- They didnt block the western ukrainian border with nato, allowing infinite supply to be delivered

&#x200B;

Anyway fuck them",xcbbth
"Russia has nuclear weapons. That is what allows them to ‚Äúplay with the big boys‚Äù so to speak. However, Pakistan also has nuclear weapons and nobody would consider them a superpower.

Unlike the U.K. (and other European countries with an empire) which was a slow burn from world power, to super power, to regional power over the course of the 20th century, Russia went from being the second (possibly even the first) great power to being a regional power overnight. 

To compensate for this, they seem to have created this image of a great power to scare the rest of the world into thinking they are simply a smaller USSR.",xcbbth
"When was Russia ever a ""super"" power? The peak of Soviet power was probably in the late 60s or maybe early 70s, when the USSR and USA were arguably close technologically and economically (due in no small part to Ukrainian technology and economy). The US maybe even lowered themselves a bit by the early 70s due to Vietnam and reliance on cheap foreign oil with subsequent embargo shock. By the late 80s, the USSR was a 3rd world country with nukes and the US was transitioning to an information and technology economy. When I first went to Russia in 1990, my first thought was that I could not believe that we were ever afraid of the USSR - EVERYTHING was broken and basic staples were literally rationed with coupons. My second thought was that we had all been duped by the western military industrial complex into fearing the big, bad USSR so that they could continue to spend money on the arms race. Even then, Ukraine was a far nicer place than Russia. 

Putin and his cronies flourished on the West's fear of a paper tiger that western politics and industry were more than happy to keep pumped up, and then even Putin himself believed the myth. This conflict was indeed inevitable in Putin's mind, and, frankly, the West was more than willing to let him execute this folly with little repercussions for themselves. Putin's big mistake was waiting until the US was no longer preoccupied with its own military fiascos. Even worse for Putin's timing was that the US had learned a lot about war in the last 20 years, and we shared the experience and technology with Ukraine. Furthermore, Ukraine and Ukrainians have always been more prosperous than Russia because they worked harder, were proud of themselves and their country, and were less corrupt than Russia (yeah, there's corruption in Ukraine, but it's not hard to be less corrupt than Russia).",xcbbth

I agree you cant be sure that this is a YPR but it's possible and ukraine soldiers are getting killed, denying this feels like coping.

Every point she made is factually correct, and on a personal level why are we sanctioning ourselves into a living cost crisis now for Russia but not for Israel or Saudi Arabia if it had anything to do with actual morals.

"A lot of warhawks on this sub. . .

She's completely right. This war is unwinnable and avoidable. 

There is this belief that Putin is an imperialist out to make Russia whole again. This is an exaggeration to justify prolonging the war. The truth is, Putin has stated way back in 2008 that Ukraine and Georgia joining Nato is a direct threat to Russia. Important side note, that America and the Soviets nearly had a nuclear war when the Soviets sent nukes to Cuba, known as the Cuban missile crisis. The nukes in Cuba were not a threat to the States, but the Americans let it be known that no adversary gets to put nukes so close to the american border. 

 In 2008, Russia faced a similar situation with Nato announcing that Georgia and Ukraine were set to join. Russia attacked Georgia over it and later attacked Ukraine in 2014. It doesn't matter that you think Nato is purely a defensive pact, if Ukraine joins then Nato forces would at Russia's doorsteps and that is unacceptable for Putin. To him, that is a national security failure. 

Believe it or not, but dictators don't like to have their power threatened. Zelenskyy should have heeded Macron's advice and conceded territory lost plus the promise of no Nato and this would be over. You may hate it, but that is the best anti-war solution. It protects europe and the world instead of threatening it. 

Currently, Russia is slowly gaining ground. They are winning and all the West could do is promise to supply Ukraine with heavier stuff. This is a ridiculous approach as it only prolongs the war. Expert say this could go on for years. The world can't handle that so let's set out a compromise.",vezam6
Finally one is telling the truth,vezam6
"She‚Äôs not wrong, she just says it without tact.  The west wants to prolong the war just to bleed Russia.  A decisive win isn‚Äôt good for the west no matter which side comes out the Victor.  The pain will be extended as long as possible.  This one sided BS has to stop.  See the big picture.",vezam6
"And you miss the point, troll.  The African Union, according to this fool, is saying sovereignty does not matter, so long as people need food. 

They are setting a precedent that their own governments are not sovereign, as they also can't feed their people.",vezam6
"Agree with her. We are now seeing the non west countries uniting. New trade agreements, removal of the US dollar as reserve currency and a stronger bond between China, Russia, Venezuela, India, Argentina, etc.

And to top that off, people are starving and dying in the US right now. Tent cities filled with homeless people. And then we send $55B to some other country, while forgetting Yemen, Somalia, Iraq, Libya, etc. just because Ukraine has white people.

Look up CBC news on racism there. Mar 1 

The guardian UK. Feb 28

Kenyan ambassador. Mar 1.",vezam6
"I agree.

Russia's invasion realy was a godsend to the worst elements in European politics.

Most importantly: It revealed just how anti democratic and pro fascist certain european politicians are. People who, if they had been politicians back during world war 2, would have appeased nazi germany for all eternity and would let nazi germany exist and continue its genocide untill today. 

She should be kicked out imediatly. Being openly antidemocratic should be a disqualifyer in any democratic government.",vezam6

I think Ukraine should get extra land for war reparations.,upgbp2
It is lucky that Zelenskyy is President of Ukraine and not Macron the appeaser.,upgbp2
Worked like a charm that time we convinced the Czechs to give up Sudentenland,upgbp2
I understand the logic to do anything to make Putin stop so give him something/anything‚Ä¶ but whatever makes Macron think Putin will stop there is his ignorance showing. Giving Putin any wins worked years ago but not anymore. Putin can and will have nothing after all this is said and done. Slava Ukraine üá∫üá¶,upgbp2
Give up Paris you french fuck,upgbp2
FU Macron. Give-up Africa.,upgbp2
Macron is an idiot. Fuck off,upgbp2
The French. Not content with their own surrender record they are now surrendering on behalf of other nations. Disgraceful Macron.,upgbp2
"First off asking Ukraine to give up territory is like asking France to give up Brittany, Britain to give up Kent or the US give up Michigan. You are asking them to give up land which is theirs as a reward to someone who has committed wholesale slaughter. It's simply morally wrong. In 91 the west didn't accept Iraq annexing Kuwait. We should not expect Ukraine to do it now.

Secondly Russia will not be satisfied with just a small part of Ukraine. They want it all in time and doing something like this simply sets the table for years of troubles and territorial disputes that would lead to another war down the road. Remember when Russia annexed Crimea? People thought that would satisfy Russia then and look where we are now. You can't give Russia an inch because as history has shown appeasement doesn't stop a war. Appeasement for ""Peace in out time"" simply postpones it and makes it inevitable.",upgbp2
"France trying to surrender a war that's not even theirs now that is a new 1 from them, plus macron is the biggest snake of them all",upgbp2
He didn‚Äôt say that but what he said was stupid indeed. I am ashamed of this statement as a frenchman.,upgbp2
"If anyone knows about giving up,
It‚Äôs the French. Worked out well for them, eh?",upgbp2
"Everybody says ‚ÄúNo more wars, we want world peace‚Äù but nobody wants to realize what that means",upgbp2

Q: Why did the French plant trees on the Champs-Elysees?

A: It is because the Germans like to march in the shade.",upgbp2
"Folks on here need to remember, Macron is not saying this is what the French PEOPLE want.  80% of French citizenry says Ukraine was wantonly attacked by Russia for unjustified reasons, and to send weapons and aid as long as one Russian has a foot on their country.

Don't blame FRANCE in general for the words of one man, even their President.  I see a lot of people doing this.  Maybe even a few too many to be believable as being spontaneous.

I think our Russian trolls are jumping on something they see as a crack in the armor of the West.  Don't feed into this idiocy.  France is with Ukraine, even if her President sticks his foot in his mouth.",upgbp2
Sounds a bit Vichy washy to me. Just what you‚Äôd  expect from the French. Also Macron can get fucked.,upgbp2
You are F......up Macron.,upgbp2
well at least it is confirmed Macron is a massive coward bitch that sucks russian dick,upgbp2
Give them a piece of France Ahole,upgbp2
No.,upgbp2
Macron is right. France should set the example by giving some of it‚Äôs territory to Russia.,upgbp2

"Ive been saying Macron is a Putin puppet since this war began. So is Germanys Scholz.

This is some cowardly nonsense by Macron. Would France do the same? Give up some of its land to make a dictator, thats murdered thousands of its citizens, happy? Clown.

This is exactly why Russia continues to do this. Concession after concession.",upgbp2
Does that surprise anyone....... from a country that got bitchkreiged in 3 days.,upgbp2
Not a bad idea. Let the Russians get out of Ukraine and they can occupy the French Riviera from Nice to Monaco... The Rainiers won't mind either... üòâ,upgbp2
Putin doesn't deserve to have a face.  Finish him.,upgbp2
Putin has in the past remarked that Macron is a weak leader. A shame Macron got re-elected.,upgbp2
Fuck Russia.. Russia have to give up some of its sovereignty and land for Ukraine to stop now.   Putin face is save or not isn't Ukraine issue,upgbp2
It's not about some land. Our people remained in the occupied cities. We won't leave them for anything.,upgbp2

"Macron needs to be sent to the front near russia for some ‚Äùreasoning‚Äù with the russians. After a few weeks of rape and torture that the civilians in areas that russians occupy are subject to, i bet he would change mind. Specially if they try force conscript him to fight Ukraine. He still thinks he can reason with the russians. Nah they just need to be crushed like bugs.",upgbp2
"lost respect for this french cunt. after serious crimes against the Ukrainian civilian population, after abuse, torture, child abuse, murder, theft etc etc the last thing putin should save is his face. he should be put in front of a court and hanged like amon g√∂th or other psychopaths in power from the past.",upgbp2
Traitor!,upgbp2
Macron you damn sissy for Putin.,upgbp2

Without questions.",upgbp2
Ah the classic French military strategy. Roll over. Let them finish.,upgbp2
Its really pathetic to talk about a small dictator losing face in the midst of a genocide taking place in Ukraine.,upgbp2
"He can suck a fat one, I hope Ukraine takes part of Russia",upgbp2
"Fuck Putin and his ego, it‚Äôs ridiculous that these leaders are even considering playing putins games.

Fuck off macron",upgbp2
Give up Corsica. It‚Äôs basically Russian already,upgbp2

"Maybe Putin should attack France and Macaron will give part of it just so Putin will save face , still hanging white flag, huh?",upgbp2
Macron is a fucking bitch boy.,upgbp2
Surrender! Sounds like a very French solution.,upgbp2
France can give land to ruzzia to save embarrassment,upgbp2
what is up with France and giving up sovereignty?,upgbp2
I hate to say but if WW3 kicks of France will flip sides,upgbp2
WHAAAAAAT?????? Wtf has he been smoking??? wtf Macron?,upgbp2
Macron.. sounds like a sweet cake..  Its more so that Macron would look like the great European leader.. Shame on you Macron. Putin only understands power,upgbp2
And I suggest that Macron go fuck himself.,upgbp2

how about you give up some of your ego first?,upgbp2
French and surrendering. Name more iconic duo,upgbp2
In Putin's case i'd prefer the old French way of saving face.  Namely guillotining his head from his neck and then casting his face in wax.,upgbp2
Eat shit,upgbp2
Fuck you macaroni,upgbp2
I‚Äôm sure Puzzy Putin rather have Paris.,upgbp2
Well done macron. Wouldn‚Äôt want Russia to look bad.,upgbp2
"How about ‚ÄúNO!‚Äù as an answer?

Or Double Fuck No!  And Macron can stop working at cross purposes to Civilization.

It‚Äôs the West against Evil.

The goal is to defeat the Russians, kick them out, and hope that Putin falls out a window!",upgbp2
"He is a russian puppet. He gave up Africa to russia already... Actions and effects are important, not words.  Africa is gone feom French hands to russians.",upgbp2
How about he give up the several overseas territories that France still has like French Guiana,upgbp2
Macron is a moron!,upgbp2
"He says the same thing about home invaders, there is a case that he spoke on saying you basically don't have a right to defend yourself. He deserves to be spoken about with harsh language.",upgbp2
"Macron maybe speaking what the rest of the world is saying, but Russia also just said once Ukraine is taken they will move to Poland and denazify it.  We all know Putin will not stop and Ukraine unfortunately has to see this war to the end or they will never be able to be at peace and other countries will fall.",upgbp2
"As someone with French and German heritage I'm constantly fighting the urge to surrender, but aggressively.

But suggesting surrendering by proxy through another country? That's a new one for me.",upgbp2

A French expert in the art of surrender.,upgbp2
Fuck Macron.,upgbp2
Macron can go to hell,upgbp2
"Ukraine is the one who needs to make that decision, because Ukranians are the ones suffering the biggest consequenses of this.  Despite that I must say that if  Russians were to be trusted  not waging war anymore, then perhaps losing land would be ok in order to achieve peace.  War destroys lives and the longer war lasts the more lives are destroyed. Therefore I can understand that people want to find solutions to end the war as quickly as possible.   
The thing is I am not sure Putin or Russia can be trusted on this.",upgbp2
"Wait, the French are saying this? Quelle surprise!   
Europe's pro capitulators.....  
Macron is deluded. He's gonna tell them to go full Vichy next.",upgbp2
As a Brit..  I can't say the French are not my favourite. However as I work there on a regular basis I do have some that I love like family but there still remains a little fuck prick called MACRON THAT I HATE WITH A PASSION!,upgbp2

How about France gives up some of its territory to Russia to allow Putin to save face?,upgbp2
This fucking guy!,upgbp2
I suggest Macron go off some fucks.,upgbp2
"Why doesn‚Äôt France offer Russia land there?  Make a second Kaliningrad.  Take the French Riviera.  How does that sound, Macron?",upgbp2
"Regarding Donetsk and Lugansk that's an actual possibility. The population there is overwhelmingly Russian/in support of Russia. Even if Ukraine wins the war those regions won't see peace. Ukraine will either have to commit an ethnic cleansing or give them up to Russia. 

A similar thing happened when the war in Croatia ended after Operation Storm in 1995. Some 200 000 - 300 000 Serbs left the country. It was sad but the best course of action for Croatia. Peace would be impossible otherwise and it would've ended up like Bosnia which is still a powderkeg today.

People don't forgive and forget in these situations. Either Russians go from Donetsk and Lugansk or Russia annexes them. I suppose the victor will determine that.",upgbp2
And why the fuck should we care of Putin saves face?,upgbp2
Fuck that,upgbp2
Wow and everyone was slagging of Marine Le Pen he ain‚Äôt no better,upgbp2

No? Didn't think so. Go home to teacher, Macron.",upgbp2
Macron should stfu and stop sucking up to Putin,upgbp2
Macron can go fuck himself.,upgbp2

Eat a bag of dicks guy should get nothing but an end of a rope,upgbp2
"Surely this is satire, amirite?",upgbp2
That‚Äôs because everyone thought they would fight like France and just give up,upgbp2
Bullshit,upgbp2
How about Macron give up a part of France in exchange?,upgbp2
"I think Macron should offer to give up the French Riviera to russia, instead. That would be about the same as Ukraine having to give up what the russians have taken from them so far. I imagine that would go over with the French about as well as Macron's suggestion does with the Ukrainians. Fuck Putin and his ugly face.",upgbp2

"Why doesnt he give some of France instead if its no big deal.

Land is land right? Doesn't really matter where it is as long as its under russian control.

Lol what for,upgbp2
"Macron is afraid of severe escalation. Giving up Crimea showed that Putin will come back later for more territory, if he is going to bring about nuclear annihilation then no one can stop him, it was all just a matter of time.

"While I appreciate Macron and Zelenskyy have a priority to stop the killing of civilians by the Putin regime as soon as they can, the reality is that Putin will keep attacking and want the total inhalation of Ukraine and it‚Äôs people as has been clearly shown already. While I am certainly not as informed and as skilled as I‚Äôd expect a country leader to be, I think Macron is misguided, even if you factor the nuclear risk into his logic.",upgbp2
"How would the French have felt had the British not fought to save France back in Works War Two, but if Churchill had appeased Hitler by letting him keep all of Northern France. That‚Äôs what Macron has been yo-yo, just like Hollande!

I hope Zelensky doesn‚Äôt entertain a visit from Macron‚Ä¶ he can go and negotiate with the genocidaire Putin.",upgbp2
of course the surrender monkeys would say that,upgbp2

I do not mind Russia, I mind Russias system of governance, a system where mobsters are in charge one of the most powerful countries, sadly this is the case in many slavic countries altho not as amplified. It‚Äôs because (in my country) after the velvet revolution the only people who knew about the business world, money and western capitalism were communists.

"Appeals to history for justification of contemporary events by a murderous Russian imperialist are utterly pointless in so many regards, not least because it‚Äôs a false equivalence. Saying ‚ÄúAmerica came close to nuclear war over Cuba‚Äù doesn‚Äôt change the fact that none of our leaders alive today in the west were anything other than babies when this all took place. 

So what are we supposed to do with this stuff, get in a time machine and undo the mistakes of our forebears? 

Stalin and Khrushchev used the most brutal conflict in history (the Second World War) to poison the earth with an ideology that turned humans into raw material. I don‚Äôt regret for one millisecond that the west stood up to them literally across the entire globe, from North Africa to Central Asia to China to Cuba. It was the absolutely 100% morally correct course and it saved humanity from permanent enslavement under an ideology which ultimately killed far more people than even Adolf Hitler managed to achieve.

Interesting how your roommate seems to think that USA tricked Russia into fighting in this horrible war but also gives reasons why the war is correct and justified.,t6refc
"I kept thinking and I have come to the conclusion that even IF the US would have ""provoked"" russia into this war.

There are no excuses, russia just should not invade into another country. And everything they do right now is their own decision all the war crimes and other unbelievable things.

The other way round if the west would ever attack russia, we would also be against it.

Just because we do not want war, no matter who against who. 

Greetings from germany, we want to live in peace together.",t6refc

He‚Äôs right about someone making money, but it won‚Äôt be America. The newly announced pipeline to China will mean China will control Russias entire economy. 

Afghanistan was a complete waste of billions of dollars. America lost money fighting that war. 

If anything, America would like to keep Russia‚Äôs internet working (not blocked) so that the Russian people can see the truth of what‚Äôs happening in Ukraine. Shutting off the internet only helps Putin‚Äôs narrative.

This isn‚Äôt about NATO, or America, or the west. This is about Ukraine having a functioning democracy with a people who are very similar to Russia. Putin can‚Äôt allow that. If his people realize how good things could be without his government, he‚Äôs fucked.",t6refc

Honestly what do you even expect? US fuuuuuuucked Syria up and Russia saved his country. So what is it you don‚Äôt understand! I myself support Ukraines right to defend themselves by any means however entire west just uniting and dumbing weapons Ukraine makes me raise an eyebrow. Educate yourself the world isn‚Äôt all black and white! US tricking Russia to attack Ukraine ye there is some truth to that as well. They didn‚Äôt trick them but rather pushed things in that direction. Don‚Äôt underestimate United States they plot for years!,t6refc
"I'm not taking sides *

I think Putin is reacting like an animal backed into a corner, and defending his territory.

Nato have expanded over the years, getting closer and closer to Russia. Putin feels threatened, and is reacting to the expansion. 
Another argument is that taking ukraine also gives him direct access to the black sea, his economy can grow if they've more shopping lanes etc. 

The economy needs a reset, certainly in America. It wouldn't surprise me if the Americans have triggered this, just by continously poking Putin into a corner. 

I'm British, I haven't seen a single piece of Russian media, before or during the invasion.

Regarding the whole 'ukranian freedom fighter unite' hype that's being rammed down Europe's throat, I think that's bollocks. Giving the general public a gun and expecting them to hold back trained Russians, I don't think so. I wish Ukrainians well but I honestly don't think they stand a chance. The fact various warcrimes have been committed already, and nato haven't intervined raises question marks.

I'm unbiased, this isn't meant to offend anyone, stay safe.",t6refc
"i have no doubt USA had some part to play in the shadows in this conflict. Putin warned the EU and america to stop moving eastward with NATO for like 20 years. You really think USA didn't know what was gonna happen? Pretty sure some think tank already theorized that if putin attacked, that USA could get the world behind it to destroy russia without even putting 1 soldier on the ground. Hit them with every sanction just fuck up their economy watch them implode.  Just read a history book on how many times USA had a hand in regime changes. Its just sad that Ukraine will be paying the price. hopefully it doesn't escalate anymore.",t6refc
Just don't try.  He has real beefs with the way history has worked out and false ones that are cultural or political excuses for real failure.  Wave him off when he tries to talk about it and watch for other signs of radicalization.,t6refc

Are you upset because he does not have unquestioning dogmatic religious belief in American propaganda ü§Ø,t6refc
"Russians have a strong connection with Syria for ages, it's logic that he thinks like this, but the Russians planned this all already last year and all started in 2014, the US just found out the old school way...someone told them.

This all can only have upset Putin more and he maybe has send the battalions in from the Commanders that betrayed him and using on other Parts more motivated soldiers, you cleary see a difference in style of soldiers in the East compared to soldiers that are caught all around Ukraine.",t6refc

"Yes. The USA alone is distributing $20 billion of weapons, not to mention all the contributions of other NATO members. Ukrainr has more soldiers than russia but has taken fewer (though high) casualties.  While it is upsetting that people in the east are dying unnecesarily, the high level reasons that ukraine will win remain true.",vaanp9
Its not a matter of whether Ukraine can go toe to toe with Russia in a war of attrition but does Russian populace support the idea of conscription to overwhelm the Ukrainians. Putin is facing the same situation US president Johnson faced in the Vietnam ‚ÄúConflict‚Äù. Will he pull draft and will the draft be faced with popular opposition?,vaanp9
"The answer is yes and no.
There‚Äôs no way Ukrainians will survive the attrition if they don‚Äôt survive the attrition. To live under Z occupation is hell and I do believe they will fight to the last to prevent this. But the real question is whether Russia will survive Ukrainian attrition. I think not. Here‚Äôs why: last solovyov propagandist show had him say something like ‚Äúlet‚Äôs widen the war and take over some countries which have factories which can make the spare parts‚Äù. Ha ha ha. First of all, they will destroy any factory they want to take over if they ever did , but most importantly it shows that they are fucked for parts and for supplies to make more war machinery: sanctions have been working. Russia is the one being attritioned !",vaanp9
"Russia is soon going to feel the economic problem the war created. Thousands of people lost their Job, knowhow and important buisness partners left russia for good. Putin wiped out 15-20 years of economic growth in only a few month. Why am I saying this? Because economy is important to keep the war machine running. He needs raw material, electronics and other Hightech stuff the russians used to get from the outside. With russia being isolated and no longer supplied they arent able to restock ammunition and Rockets as easily 

At this point i dont See how russia wants to win this because of a few simple problems. Lets think about the worst case for a Moment. Russia defeats Ukraine, installs a puppet government and integrates Ukraine back into russia. What now? You bombed the country to the ground, Ukraine needs to rebuild before you can benefit from them. The war wipped out a lot of russias military, which would have to rebuild for years to come, maybe even decades. Normality wouldnt return because almost no country would accept russias lies and conquering. Which means a new iron curtain would be the result. Europe and america would keep their sanctions in place, which would reduce economic recovery and growth to a minimum as well. 

Why am I tipping all this? Because i wanted to say, it doesnt matter if Ukraine wins (which i still hope they do), russia cant win anything in the long run. They lost the Moment they crossed the border into Ukraine.

Russia has almost no friends or allies, Ukraine kicks their asses, the economy is failing and the West is militarizing to a degree not seen since the end of WW2. Russia is done, as simpel as that",vaanp9
"In Sevierodonesk (take a drink if I botched that one) it is said the Ukrainians are outnumbered 5 to 1.  They are far outnumbered on artillery too, between 20 to 1 and 40 to 1.  If those odds are correct, the UA is doing a hell of a job.  But in that region there around 10,000 UA soldiers.  Russians say, 50,000.  These number have been depleted on both sides since then.  

Lysychansk (take another drink if need be) has the high ground to look overlook Sevierodonesk.  So they can pummel Russians for as long as they can, inflicting severe damage, if they can keep up with the artillery they need.  But if the Popasna front loses the main road, these forces are cut off and must rely on what they have left and what can get filtered through.  

So we go to Solvyansk (we getting tipsy yet).  It's reported there are about 70,000 Ukrainians in this area.  It stretches out quite a bit, but still, 70,000.  If they stay supplied with ammo, artillery, rotations, food, water.  This group can hold out for along time for more NATO weaponry, plus the training needed to update the Ukrainians on newer, NATO upgraded, non-soviet Era weopnary that could change the course of the war.  

The thing is, the Russians are losing experienced soldiers, as is the UA.  Both at a ridiculously high rate everyday.  The Russians are a mortgage company that is hassling Ukrainians everyday for a mortgage payment. And they comeback with a reason for them to not foreclose.  

The Russians are masters of trench warfare, but today's technology can kind of hit that trench system to great affect.  But the trouble the UA runs into the artillery comparison.  

The Russians fairly exceed the Ukrainians on Soviet-Era artillery and NATO hasn't provided enough to cover it. 

Apparently and US gave Ukraine 108 of 118 M777 Howitzers available.  There isn't much to give unless significant training is available on HIMARS.  So, current training wise, what's left to give?  It's going to take time to train and give Ukraine the heavy weaponry on our post-Soviet level weaponry. 

Unfortunately, Ukraine will lose a good amount of territory unless former Soviet-Bloc countries release their entire Soviet-Era weaponry, which the Ukrainians are familiar with.  

They just need time to use familiar equipment, get trained on upgraded NATO equipment to really fight back.

Don't get me wrong, the UA is putting up a fight like no else can.  But they need the heavy, more modern weapons NATO can provide.  They just need the time to train for it, and that training time will result in heavy casualties.  

Give them hell, Ukrainians and the Foreign Legion.....  Eventually the weapons will get to you.....",vaanp9
"This a legitimate concern, Ukraine has one third the population Russia has, so it can NOT afford to lose 1 soldier for every soldier Russia loses. Also since the war is on Ukraine soil, civilians living in areas Russia has gained control can't be drafted to fight, Ukraine civilians killed by Russia can't be drafted to fight and Ukraine civilian refugees that manage to leave the country can't be drafted to fight (though Ukraine has blocked military aged males to leave for this reason)   
 In a grinding attrition war - Russia could win by keeping the war going long enough and inflicting enough death on Ukraine in the process.  
On the flip Russia has a serious problem with recruitment - Ukraine openly acknowledges it is in a war for its existence and has drafted reservists and formed civilian militias in an effort to have enough troops to keep fighting. Russia has not openly acknowledged how poorly the situation is going in Ukraine and therefor declaring war, mobilizing its reserves and initializing a draft beyond the normal conscription rotation would fly in the face of the information that has been provided to the public and risk destabilizing Putin's control of Russia. 

Russia will continue to use other means to keep its military properly manned, like drafting men from occupied parts of Ukraine, hiring mercenaries from other countries allied with it, and drafting prisoners. 

I think the biggest risk is that Russia, achieves an objective that they can sell to the public, like the capture of the Donbas region and they dig in behind a defensive natural barrier (most likely a river), set up their artillery and just build better and better fortifications. Ukraine may not have enough soldiers to dislodge them - as offensive operations between equal foes, require the attacking side to outnumber the defenders. I don't think Russia is capable to much more of Ukraine than it already has, but it would be awful if they do manage to hang on to what they managed to control.",vaanp9
"They absolutely can, because there are so many factors at play. Russias advance has been incredibly slow and (as far as I can tell) incredibly costly.

Mounting pressure at home, both financial and political, could force Putin to declare some kind of strategic victory and pull out, or that he's happy with holding whatever land he's taken and come to some kind of peace.

They're in a bad situation but total defeat isn't inevitable.",vaanp9
"From what I can tell, Russia has fundamentally lost the initiative. The war has become an artillery duel especially on the eastern front. 

Russia has the materiel to survive attrition but not the man power.

Ukraine possesses the manpower but lacks the overwhelming quantity of materiel that Russia possesses.

This war is not really a war of attrition though, never was. It is a race against the clock. Russia is attempting to secure victory before their economy collapses. In their view if they can secure victory, they can begin to normalize foreign relations and save their economy.

Ukraine can not, and will not win this through overwhelming force or tactics. The strategy is to keep Russians fighting until the Russian economy implodes. Ukraine just needs to keep fighting until Russia has no economy left.",vaanp9
"Other sites I am in says Russia is out numbering at least 10-1. It is a matter of short time and ukraine will be out of fighters unless the west gives them the fighters and bombers to push Russia back. 
Another site says losing at least 100 killed per day and 500 wounded.",vaanp9
"They kinda have to.

This is like the Vietnamese against the US.  They got nowhere else to go.  They either survive or die.  The invader doesn't have that motivation.",vaanp9
"I would not say that it entirely depends upon western support. No doubt the continued flow of modern arms to the country will be crucial in the continued efforts but a more critical factor will be how the Ukrainians combat the Russians. This far the Ukrainians have shown much better command structure and tactics, trading land for space and lived to keep their forces in a fighting condition, if they continue to outwit and surprise the Russians yes I do believe they can hold on.",vaanp9
"It depends entirely on the level of western support. As it is today, western weapons are arriving too slowly and in not enough numbers to fully cover all Ukrainian losses in material, but stepping up shipments to Ukraine, specially in heavy artillery, could very easily make a war of attrition winning for Ukraine as the Russians continue to sustain losses.",vaanp9

If all foreign countries stop doing business with Russia until Putin and his government run out of money. Yes. Ukraine can win.,vaanp9
"Absolutely, they will. They won‚Äôt be forgotten or abandoned by the west. They will continue to be supported both military wise and financially until they no longer need it.  Trust and believe.",vaanp9
"Yes. This is the perfect opportunity for the west to remove Russia as a destabilizing factor in Europe, Russia as a super power, and ultimately Putin without direct engagement with Russia.

And even if Russia would finally manage somehow to conquer Ukraine it would have still sustained massive losses to it‚Äôs military. Not to mention the economy of the country. It will take decades for Russia to rebuild it‚Äôs military tp anything near what it was before the war and even then it was not much iin comparisson to western military.",vaanp9
"There are 3 things to consider:
- manpower
- weapons
- experience

It seems there are enough potential soldiers in Ukraine, but a lot lack experience and especially a lack of officers can be a problem later on. Let's hope they are investing time and resources in new recruits. Whether Ukraine can keep up with artrition is also dependant on weapons supplies from the western allies. I hope the US and other allies are already looking into supplying western tanks, because sooner or later the T72's from poland and other countries will run out. Also supplying of beter AA or even helicopters should be considered already. Most countries have decided to stop telling what they are sending. Let's hope they will not wait too long with making decisions.",vaanp9
"I want Ukraine to kick Ruzzia's ass. Doesn't mean it's going to happen though. If this war drags on another year for example, with no changes to the status quo, Ruzzia will continue to slowly steal land to about 40% of Ukraine. Rough figures.

So what can make the war turn?

The sanctions actually do something. So far I have yet to see the sanctions doing the type of damage needed to make Ruzzia leave Ukraine.

The west absolutely floods the Ukrainian army with very precise missiles and drones. There has not been enough of those to inflict the type of damage that Ruzzia's army is significantly downgraded.

Realistically, that's all I see. I don't want to be less than optimistic and it hurts  to accept this, but crunching the numbers, that's what i see because Ukraine's economy is destroyed more than Ruzzia's economy. Because Ukraine has less tanks and artillery to begin with, much less. Because Ukraine's army is much smaller. Because thousands of Ukrainian towns keep getting destroyed, factories, railroads, number of Ruzzian towns destroyed-zero. Because the Ruzzians are stealing grain, electricity from the nuclear plant, household items, cars, stealing people! They will steal anything and destroy anything. The slow loss of villages over a long attrition war, one by one is painful, more painful than a quick takeover would have been. I want Ukraine and the west to inflict such destruction on Ruzzia that it goes home with its tail between its legs and self-destructs from there. But realistically, Ukraine needs an advantage that it currently doesn't have!",vaanp9

"1.

&#x200B;

50% of the world gdp is on the side of Ukraine most of those economies are same or less affected by the economic slow down than the average country on earth basically operating well.

Making Ukraines material losses possible to replace, with constant updates to higher tech and new models etc.

Nothing they loose (almost) represents more than 100% of production capacity for the item in question within these countries combined.

&#x200B;

Russia is rearmed, and pay all extra costs because of Ukraine from the might of 1.5% of the world economy, pre war.

While unemployment is ticking up by 5-10k jobs/day lowering the tax base while raising costs. The one tank factory they have can't produce high tech tanks because lack of parts and is basically standing still. Even at full production speed they loose tanks 2-5 times faster than they have capacity to replace them in the best of times and it would already take them 2-3 years to replace what they have lost if they could.

But modern tanks they cant produce already, and hence most of what they get as replacements now is from deep storage.

The same is true for much of their material. And development to not fall even more behind as Ukraine gets more and more stuff that is more and more cutting edge.

They also can't leave unemployed starving and pensions unpayed etc as the risk of civil unrest is an even bigger fear than a loss in Ukraine in Kremlin.

Also, these sanctions are sometimes ridiculed but if you have some knowledge in national and international economics you know that the sanctions Russia is under now is nothing short of barbaric.

Nothing like this has been done to a country in 100 years and in an economy as the worlds is now... these are without bottom. Other sanctions Russia has faced basically lower the ceiling and the potential of the economy in the country and they adapt to a bit less optimal circumstanses.

That is not the case with the present ones. They are designed to strike everywhere at once in such a way that the stress every section in the economy gets subjected to is impossible to fix. And this and next month will see multiple such sectors collapse from stocks running out, rent in malls and for appartment houses (from more and more unemployed) will start causing losses that spirals out of control fast. Especially since the interest rates because of the instability and constant lying that has made it impossible to predic how russia will behave, even with signed contracts and the word of their president behind something.

And the thing with an integrated economy is that you can loose a sector in an instant but to get it up and running in tune with everything takes years.

Look how long it took for the economy to recover in the US housing sector after 2008.

In a country that for the rest was running on full.

Russia has multiple sectors about to crash far beyond what the government can stop, since they can't basically borrow money, AND lost like 60% of their money abroad after feb 24th.

There is nothing to support key sectors even and lets say housing takes a serious hit for instance, that will spread to banks and insurance companies. As money start running out, and it will... stuff like health care workers, administrators, cops etc wont get payed consistently and public spending at that time stops completelly except for essentials.

Bringing down other sectors like electronics, clothes, restaurants.

Transport sector will start suffering from lack of vehicle maintenence from lack of some parts, which is enough.

A big batch of young adults are ready with school and would normally get jobs they are now competing with loads of experienced workers against. As people in all sectors loose their jobs fast now, Very few fresh out of school will get jobs in Russia this year.

They wont move away from home buying furniture etc ....

&#x200B;

An economy suffering multiple sector collapses simultaneously supported by a government without access to extreme amounts of cash.... will soon find itself in an accelerating spiral that cant be stopped in any way except by years of steady predictable growth.

The closest exemple I can give is Greece a decade back, they got extreme help from the EU to stop a total collapse and is still a decade away from bouncing back now.

Russia will hit that same spiral in week or few months now, and there is noone and nothing to break then.

They have Oil and gas but even those sectors will soon not be able to keep up the same production temp as earlier because they need a functioning economy for that. Like in Venezuela, economy crashed. They had HUGE oil industry to still survive. It stopped too anyeway.

Lack of maintenance, access to capital. Transports etc.

And even with oil running on full it is far from enough to keep all of russia afloat.

&#x200B;

As I see it their only chance is a revolution now. Drag Putin out on the street, kill him. Ask for international help to reorganice a functioning government governd by law that shows a real interest in becoming a civilized part of the world community.

Because as long as Putin lives, he will do anything to keep this going rather than having to tell the nation that they have lost more soldiers in 4 month of special opoeration in Ukraine than in every war they have fought the last 50 years - combined.

For nothing.",vaanp9

"I think this is a misunderstanding of the current situation, and one that if shared by Ukrainian forces, could prove fatal. As a result of the peace talks today Russia agreed to cut back on offensive operations around Kyiv and Chernihiv, this is including some units leaving the area. This has been done for two reasons:

1) This de-escalation helps them as part of negotiations, and

2) the VDV assault units they are moving are wasted in defensive positions around Kyiv and Chernihiv, they are likely being redeployed to the Donbas which is the current operational focus for the Russian military.

Now why would it be a bad idea for Ukraine to pursue the Russian units who are pulling back? Disregarding the fact that some have already made it to Belarus and been transported, there are still Russian units dug into defensive positions, especially around Kyiv, this is to fix the Ukrainian military in place. If Ukrainian forces were to attempt to harass the units who are pulling out, they will weaken their positions around Kyiv which the remaining Russian units may be able to re-enter.",tr4vtz

"This is not really correct. The Azovstal soldiers' surrender (edit: only the wounded? Are there soldiers still left in the plant? Would be great news) is a bitter fact to swallow but for several days now they were unable to seriously pose a threat to the ""land bridge"" anymore, the Russians could just drive far enough from Azovstal through the ruins of Mariupol to avoid them.

Let's be realistic, this is a pyrrhic victory for Russia and yet another humiliation of the ""2nd best army of the world"". There is no way anyone with 3 working neurons left in their heads will think the incredible effort and manpower that was expended by Russia to capture the city (now a ruined wasteland) was worth it.

Mariupol was supposed to fall in less than 24 hours, and for almost *3 months* they have destroyed or at least pinned down an enormous amount of manpower and material that would have been used somewhere else and in my opinion have had a huge contribution to Ukraine's war effort. They have earned their status as heroes many times over.

In 1987 during the Iraq Iran War the US reflagged 11 oil tankers from Kuwait making them US ships and thus they could receive US naval protection.

"Cities? Absolutely, 100%, no fucking way. That reduces the Ukrainians to the level of the Russians. 
Ships? That‚Äôs a thing that I could get behind - assuming they‚Äôre military ships anyway.",tdz67m
"An attack on Russian cities would only lead to the steeling of Russia against Ukraine, meaning that suddenly any price or action would be considered justifiable to get revenge.",tdz67m
"I am convinced Putin wants to be attacked. One attack on Russian soil will put all the Russian public firmly behind Putin. In years to come, the question of who attacked who first will be much less important.

Russia's view 1950 to now: ""the west is out to get us, they want to destroy us.""
15 March 2022: Western missile hits Moscow.
16 march to the end of time, ""see, I told you they were out to destroy us""",tdz67m
"Cities? No, why lower ourselves to the Russian standard? We are better than that. Military locations in Russia and ships? 100% yes.",tdz67m
"Yes, but Ukraine would benefit far more from destroying railroad tracks in uninhabited areas than they would by launching indiscriminate attacks against populated urban centers. Russia already has the monopoly on that anyway.",tdz67m
"For defensive purposes.  Yes.  If the RU wishes to hit the Ukraine supply chain, drop a cruise missile on the incoming Russian convoys.  RU build up inside of Ukraine?  Yep - that‚Äôs a missile.  At this point I would expect some restraint be exercised in targeting infrastructure inside of Russia.  At the same time, NATO best be ready to hit that very same infrastructure ‚Äòat the push of a button‚Äô.",tdz67m
"Yes, 15 days ago",tdz67m
"they should of rushed C RAMS into protect Kiev and the other major Citys from the massive amount of incoming rocket arty morty, Patriot batteries, the works. this is all wishful thinking and guess what, foreign policy shits on  wishful thinking...",tdz67m
They should but they won‚Äôt,tdz67m
"Not necessarily Russian cities, but hitting military and logistical targets within Russia could really send a shock through the country. But, could also lead to much worse reprisals.",tdz67m
Definitely need the anti-ship missiles to sink the Russian Black Sea fleet.,tdz67m
to hit the focken kremlin,tdz67m
They need more sophisticated weapons to strike more distant Russian military targets with precision. That will result in more serious negotiations.,tdz67m
We need boots (Nato troops) on the ground. It's time to call Putin's nuclear bluff.,tdz67m
"Absolutely, time to destroy some Russian cities",tdz67m
Absolutely.. even if they don‚Äôt target Russian territory the fact that they are capable of doing so could change the situation.,tdz67m
Yes,tdz67m
"Why would Ukraine even want to hit Russian cities? Aren't they of the view that hitting civilian targets a war crime? I'd much rather see them using such missiles to attack Russian airbases or supply depots for instance. 

Hitting warships is fine, but I don't think that's very high on the priority list in the Ukrainian's hit list at the moment as they seem to be pretty harmlessly sitting in the middle of the Black sea. 

They should be given more drones and missiles to those drones. Maybe also weapons that could be used for counter battery fire like MRLS systems. I'm not sure how quick is it to train crews to these systems. If that takes a long time, then may not be optimal weapon systems either.",tdz67m
Theyve done jack shit so anything epild be good,tdz67m
NATO must keep providing advance weapons to Ukraine BUT all details must be kept in secret since a lot of information is shared with ruskis and that‚Äôs against Ukrainian interest,tdz67m
"Absolutely.  Cruise missiles reaper drones Aim 9 ata missiles.  Why the hell not.
Rattle Windows in Moscow let them feel fear.",tdz67m
They should be supplying CRAMs to counter cruise and ballistic missiles and a/c.  Plus counter-battery radar units.  Not hard to truck across the border.,tdz67m
It'd be nice to give Ukrainians a few dozen cruise missiles to clobber directly at the Kremlin.,tdz67m
"I don't think that would be helpful, it will escalate the hate and give putin the propaganda to rile up the citizens. 

Disruption of suppliers, communication and freedom of movement while targeting the command elements will drain the Russians of essentials and morale. The Ukrainians are fighting a tactical retreat and gorilla tactics combined with the rasputitsa (boggy ground) season while is smart. Ukraine cares about Every soldier and realise how precious they are, giving ground where needed to retreat and regroup rather than throwing lives away unnecessarily. 

I pray this ends soon",tdz67m
"Right now the only people able to justify Russias actions are the criminal states that support them. The entire rest of the world is learning to exclude Russia from everything.

Ukraine, as much as it might seem justified, would lose much of this support if they moved from defe sive to offensive actions. 

It does suck, but that's the world. 

I don't see a good end for Ukraine in this, except as a rallying cry to permanently ostracize Russia from all commerce, science and social interaction with the rest of the world.",tdz67m
Who is asking this? How old are you? 14? Russia would responde with nuclear warheads. Ukraine must seatdown and negotiate with Russia. There is no other option or way out. It's turning into a rubble every day that goes by.,tdz67m
"Ships and military\launch facilities, yes; cities, even if they have offensive capabilities there, no, for multiple reasons among which is that they'd lose support that keeps them afloat.",tdz67m
"Because unfortunately I believe this conflict won't end until Russian cities and infrastructure especially their oil infrastructure starts getting destroyed. 

Just think the Russian government is going to have to explain to its people why cruise missiles are hitting Moscow.",tdz67m
absolutely,tdz67m
"Attacking russia would support their narrative and cause civilian casualties, so no they shouldnt. Bombing everything belorusian or russian military in their own country and taking back the lands that were stolen from them? Yes.",tdz67m
"Russian military targets and infrastructure yes, civilian populated areas no. 
1. Don't stoop to their level 
2. Don't fuel their propaganda",tdz67m
yes,tdz67m
Yes. A no fly zone. And anything more to stop Putin.,tdz67m
No.,tdz67m
"Not Russian  cities, no",tdz67m
"i think this is pretty much a non-starter

in order to install such military infrastructure you'd need advisers and trainers. i.e. **boots on the ground**

so that's a definite no.",tdz67m
"Ships yes,City‚Äôs no.",tdz67m
"Cities no. Much as I'm angry at Russia, replying by destroying Russian civilians is absolutely not the answer, and would legitimise the use of nuclear weapons by Russia in response.

Military ships are fair game. Russia wouldn't hesitate to (try and) buy a missile from China and use it against the Ukrainian navy if it wanted to.",tdz67m
"They‚Äôve already been using their own designed Neptune missile to target Russian Naval assets. But we should absolutely give them more. For defense, if they start striking Russian cities I think it will no longer be a non nuclear war.",tdz67m
Is this a viable option?,tdz67m
"I would rather we give them the means to *steal* Russian warships as opposed to just destroying them. If it's necessary then it's necessary, but if they can be stolen to add to Team Ukraine then they should be.",tdz67m
Don't think Ukraine has a platform for firing cruise missiles.,tdz67m
"Agree 100% keep it in their own borders, maybe take out that bridge that was built to link Russia with crymear",tdz67m
"I don't believe the Ukrainians have any western aircraft capable of carrying and launching NATO's cruise missiles, but I'm sure if somebody from Jane's Air Forces of the World is lurking around, they could confirm or deny.",tdz67m
Hell no that would put us closer to war I feel like,tdz67m
To take back Ukraine and to hit ships yes.  Attacking Russian cities is not a good idea as it just leads to Ukrainians starting a long drawn out war. Just like Ireland and England or the Middle East.  Take your land back and defend that is the primary goal first.,tdz67m
"I think the issue is the training required to operate those weapons systems would be infeasible right now.  The weapons NATO is providing are weapons systems that don't require much in the way of training, or are systems the Ukrainians have already trained extensively on.",tdz67m
The problem is they don't have the training for advanced weapon systems. It's not like they can just be given a Quick Start guide and off they go.,tdz67m
Go after the military bases in Russia and Belarus where the Russians are launching there Warplanes and Cruise Missiles ... No problem with them going after military targets,tdz67m

I'd love a sub that actually looked past the propaganda and biases, but it remains unfound and I doubt at this point there is anywhere on Reddit being objective. Most the comments here make it clear that people here desire propaganda to coddle up with.",wimsnn
Lame. üëé,wimsnn

"They were not over the sea. They both crashed on land, some 11-15 km away from the base. The cause of the crashes seems to be really bad weather. Also‚Ä¶ I must mention, just to clarify the context: the MIG disappeared on the radars and lost communication with base, presumed crashed. The IAR went on a search and rescue mission after the MIG and they actually got to report really bad weather before crashing. It‚Äôs an unfortunate event. Really tragic, but nothing to do with the conflict in Ukraine. Calm down. P.S. the GPS on the pilot‚Äôs seat in the MIG has not gone off, which could mean he didn‚Äôt get to eject.

Polls don‚Äôt work in Russia. Imagine speaking your mind in fascist state. Of course you will show support. But no one from these 80% will try to save this regime when it will be falling.,vzjpzs
"Imagine, you in ussr, in 1938. Some is asking, do you support Stalin? What will you answer to them?",vzjpzs
As a Iranian who lives under dictatorial own government rules and as well as  Russia  (because  Russia is master of our government) . Say nooooo,vzjpzs
"I'm from the UK and I'm an admin of a small gaming community of about 100 people, age range 15-30 - 75% Russians, 20% other Ukrainian/other Eastern Europe, 5% EU. And I can safely say at least 80% of those Russians are against this war, with only 2 or 3 actually openly pro-Putin. So from my small sample size I can safely say that most (young) Russians are not for this war at all. This poll may reflect the opinions of those 50+ but certainly not younger people. Additionally, all 4 of our Belarusians are against it too.",vzjpzs
"I'd be cautious in trusting any polls coming out of Russia that is clearly lying and twisting truths to fit their agendas, not to mention the crackdown on any form of dissent would make people lie on polls.

Do you trust polls from North Korea?",vzjpzs

The only thing that should be supporting putin is a rope.,vzjpzs
"Keep in mind, that these surveys usually happen by phone calls middle of the workdays. People who actually take these surveys are either lonely elderly stuck on their ways, or drunkards sitting in their effeciency apartments reminscising about their old days.

"You underestimate how effective propaganda is and take our access to information for granted. 

Remember, we have people in the west, where information can be critiqued and verified, who still believe naked absurdities (think anti-vaxxers, people who believe the 2020 US election was stolen, etc.)

Now imagine you live in a society where you have zero access to independent or verifiable information.",vzjpzs
"as a russian: i dont support putins fascism at all and im pretty sure that the survey is a total lie, i know putin would be trusted only by 15%-40% of the population if the survey wasnt rigged",vzjpzs
You do realize that most of Russia relies on government influenced medias for the news yeah? People can fooled easily,vzjpzs
Not necessarily idiots but fed propaganda everywhere 24/7 without opposing viewpoints! Even this poll is probably propaganda! The real approval rate is probably below 30% and even lower among non city dwellers!,vzjpzs
It‚Äôs like asking people on death row if they support the death sentence!,vzjpzs

I support ramming his head up Lenin‚Äôs ass and making the tomb a double.,vzjpzs
"They're not idiots, you can't just group all of those people together. Yes, there will be some actual idiots in the 80% but you have you consider the fact that they are being fed a constant stream of misinformation and disinformation/propaganda. Many Russian citizens do not have the privilege of seeing what's actually happening in the world and I find that sad.",vzjpzs
"as a russian activist once said, its obvious that most people will either not respond or will lie about it, speaking your mind in a dictatorship is like asking to get killed.",vzjpzs
"You cant trust it. According to Kim Jong Un 100% of north corea trust in his leadership...  
Rusia did never admit any crime, any mistakes, any manipulation, any anything in all its history. Why would should they now admit real numbers...  


Watch the youtube channel ""1420"" there you will hear some different real russian opinions about the war and everything that has to do with it.",vzjpzs

Unlike Biden putins poll numbers have skyrocketed",vzjpzs
"Well, they don't support fascism - they don't have swastikas' on national symbols and that's what fascism is about, right? 

They only support Ruzzia being the only honest, fair and holy country it the world. All the bombing, shelling, killing, all the lies - that's not them, that's the Western provocations. They only bringing peace to Ukrainians (who are basically Russians who forgot about it, and their Holy Mission is to bring them back to light and kill all Nazis who disagree). 

They are not idiots. They are... well, orcs. In Tolkien's understanding of the term. They were normal people once, corrupted into beings who call the darkness light.",vzjpzs

Hell no.  Fuck Putin and all his sheep,vzjpzs

Rather than making their country and lives for Russians better they choose to destroy the lives of others. Also, they lie and try to get Russians to rally around killing and destroying others as if it's something to be proud of or something. Rather than making the world better they destroy it. What's to be proud of a legacy like that, nothing. So no, I, do not support Russia I am enraged that this is the legacy they leave their kids. It's disgusting in every way.",vzjpzs
The man is utter filth,vzjpzs
Seems as accurate as their election counts though‚Ä¶,vzjpzs
"LOL, just like his ""elections""!",vzjpzs
"First, if you lived in Russia, would you admit in a public poll that you oppose Putin?  People are getting years in prison just for calling the war in Ukraine a war, instead of a ""special operation.""  This is not the time to be honest if you live there and want to keep living your life.

Second, many Russians get all their news from state controlled media.  They may or may not be stupid, but they're certainly behind the times when it comes to sourcing good information.  So they swallow the propaganda (hook, line and sinker).",vzjpzs
My thoughts are-- everytime I see a photo of this fucker with his unexpressive dead soul poker face I want to rearrange his face the same way he wants to rearrange Ukraine.,vzjpzs

Yes, I know what happens in those kind of societies. It's been a while, but I remember, and I keep my own council, thankyou very much.",vzjpzs

"He is not a fascist. He is more of a authoritarian and nationalist. There is hug difference between a nationalist and fascist. If you want to talk about fasicsm I would direct you towards Hitler and Stephan Bandera (National Hero of Ukraine). The Russians are rallying behind Putin because they see that the collective West has declared a total economic war on Russia ( which isn't working out quite well) and have stated that their primary goal is to annihilate the russian economy and weaken Russia over all. Obviously in such a case, the people rally behind the leader.
If you want to look at the idiots, look at the Western leaders who are fighting an unnecessary war which is proving detrimental to their own economies and zelensky who is sacrificing his country and countrymen by pursuing a suicidal policy instead of negotiating with russia and getting a surrender approved.

"I went to the Dominican Republic at the end of January 2022, right before the invasion basically - when Rus was amassing forces at the border. 

I met a nice Russian girl there and another Russian couple (I'm Canadian) with the one girl speaking some English and the other couple nearly No English.

We had a great time in the sun, drinking and mingling.

When the war broke out, I had texted the Gentleman from the other couple.  He's a mid-30s guy, seemed smart, and funny and knowledgeable.  I basically said what i was seeing and hope he's okay and to stay away from those areas.

His reply however, blew me away a bit and I was surprised and immediately convinced they're basically brainwashed.

He spoke of ""living next to Nazis"" and some other nonsense.  

Couldn't believe he's bought into that narrative, as he seemed decently intelligent to seek out alternative sources of information... so, in Ruzz, likely whole generations who have been exposed to nothing but nonsensical BS from state media",w7nsal
"Not everyone makes a big deal about the war. I, an American, keep up on it and spend at least 30 minutes a day everyday reading about, posting thoughts, and doing further research on things i learn that i want to know more about. For example I look up every piece of equipment  that the Ukrainians are being sent because i am interested in how helpful it might be. 

My wife doesn't talk about the war nor does she read about it that i know of. She supports Ukraine but you would only know that if you mentioned something to her regarding that. But she has done things to support Ukrainians that only i am aware of because I am her husband and live with her. 

She has supported, financially, verified Ukrainians on Etsy by buying digital good from them. She has bought merch from everyone's favorite Jack Russell Terrier, Patron. She has given money to Zelensky's U24 Initiative. She, since the war started,  became a member of Rick The Hedgehog (who lives in Lviv) Patreon. Rick's owners donate some of their income to the war effort. Finally, she has volunteered a few times to put together aid packages for displaced Ukrainians. 

But if you look at her social media, you won't see any of this. In fact, her own family, doesn't know all the ways she supports Ukraine. They just know she supports Ukraine. I am very vocal about my support and i have donated as well, but i am quite vocal about it because i live in a privileged country.  Everyone should be able to enjoy their life in a free country without fear of  war taking everything they know and love away. 

Not everyone post every detail of their life on social media not even in a free country in which a majority of the population supports Ukraine.  I know people who live in Russia that i have met through games and social media. Almost all of them do not support Putin and are embarrassed to be Russian. 

If you truly know these people you met, then you should know if they support Putin or Ukraine without them being vocal about it on social media. Posting such things on social media is large risk for Russians and not all Russians are willing to risk their lives and what little freedom they have to be publicly against Putin when in their opinion it will change nothing for them to do so.",w7nsal
"I an fairly certain they have their opinions about what is going on, but may not post these opinions online. I hear a lot about how ordinary Russians domestically are brainwashed through state media, but I don‚Äôt really buy in to that. There is more to that story, especially with young people.

Fascinatingly, you can go in to an ex-pat Russian language FB-page (use translate) and notice how absent the Ukraine war is. It is as somehow this is a non-topic, like some sort of ceasefire. 

I have no doubt some don‚Äôt touch the topic out of conflicting emotions and even shame, but what I find the most appalling is how many Russians support the war even when living in a Western country for decades. Silence would be preferable from what some of these dormant orcs manage to spew out on a closed FB-group‚Ä¶",w7nsal
"Tbh they might not even know about the true meaning behind their special operations aswell maybe they don‚Äôt give a shit because they are not into wars. In Canada there was a huge phase of people posting about abortions laws in the states, something that does not concern Canada however I haven‚Äôt seen one person on social media comment on the war in Ukraine. It seems your either passionately against the war, don‚Äôt care or just like to hop on social trends IMO",w7nsal
"If I were Russian I would not be posting anything negative about Putin, including the war. It's not just that he kills his enemies anywhere in the world, it's that I have a duty to shield my daughter from harm. I have no doubt he would go after my family if it suited him. I'm an American so feel fairly safe to say Putin is 'the 21st century version of Hitler, just a Nazi in disguise'. (Since he likes to call everyone else a Nazi I figure that would hit him harder than a 'thug with a Napoleon complex')",w7nsal
"I am a Ukrainian and I happen to have had quite a few online friends from russia before the war. Two of them are completely devastated about what happened. One of those two posted online for a while, another went to protests until he got arrested for it. Then both of them stopped doing anything except for checking in on me from time to time. The rest of the people just texted me ""I'm so sorry"" on Feb 24, considered their mission accomplished, and never contacted me since, never acknowledged anything publicly and just carried on with their lives. Also, there was one person who told me that we were bombing ourselves.

I eventually cut contact with all of those people, because seeing their lattes and pretty sunsets is absolutely infuriating to me. Every time I look up at the sky I am subconsciously checking it for rockets, and I hate it that they're posting it so casually (idk, pictures of the sky is my personal pet peeve). Also, most social media is blocked in their country, so they specifically installed VPN to show this to whom? To Ukrainians who did not get around to unfollowing them still? 

Basically, personally, I am very peeved they go on as if nothing happened and never post about what's going on. I get it that they are scared to express any protest or whatever. I even don't mind those who stopped posting anything at all, but I do mind those who post shit like everything is fine.

So yeah. You have my blessing to call them out. Their behavior is hurtful.",w7nsal
"I think as long as they don't post pro-war stuff, I'd probably let them be (and survive).",w7nsal

"Friendship is earned, not just a given. If  these people cannot see the error of their ways, they do not deserve your friendship!",w7nsal
"Just relax who cares if they don't want to get into the geopolitical policies of their country if they were in Ukraine killing civilians and posting on social media that would be one thing. Are we all supposed to not enjoy our short time on this Earth should we live and die by the policies our country mix cuz in America it's not going so well for women or anybody part of the lgbtq community. Should I stop posting about sports on Twitter because crazy congresswomen are saying that we should get rid of separation of church and state and run the entire country based on the Christian Bible?

I completely understand that you want people in your circle to be bothered by the same things that bother you or maybe they aren't going to be the same reactions that you are having.

But my opinion is whatever you need to do to get through your day whether it's posting irrelevant conversations about sporting events or nonsense about going to the club we have to find an outlet to enjoy life.",w7nsal

September 2021 russia launch a cyber attack on  the german parliament. Russia german trade increase significantly after the fact. 

November 2021  nato ( whish germany is part of) alliance noted a large number of troops moving towards the ukraine russia border.  

January 2022 germany offers 5000  helmets to ukraine forces for the eventual invasion meanwhile  other countries sends many forms of protection and armaments whish to be crucial for the defense of kyviv and the expelling of russian forces in the norther part of ukraine.  

February  2022 russia launch the invasion of ukraine. Whish every nato country knew by that time  and germany drags their feet to be pro active  against the Russian government.

"None of those. 

Fighting continues for a month or three more but devolving into lower and lower intensity conflict. 

Putin scrambles to use the situation to consolidate power in some kind of Plan C. 

Once he feels he has the best personal outcome, he will spin the ending scenario to suit his own needs. 

OR

Putin is eliminated and the situation normalises quite rapidly from an outside perspective, but the infighting for power will be intense in Russia.

"1. This war cannot last more than a year, it is currently at WWII levels of casualty and costs.
2. NATO still has not sent in all the systems and arms it can provide. It literally is still buying gas and oil from Russia (which they have to stop).
3. As warmer weather comes and plans solidify, NATO will pull the plug on all Russia energy exports. 

Russia will lose and NATO wants the world to see how Ukraine beat them alone, this is much more damaging to Russia than even losing to NATO. 

But NATO must send Ukraine much more aid, and immediately.",tki2by
"Fighting continues for a few months, ceasefires are created and broken several times.

Russia may have trouble paying the troops. So perhaps another option is Russia consolidates in the south but eventually a change in power happens allowing for re unification of Ukrainian.,tki2by

i dont think we are looking at at a ww3 at all the only reason people think this is because its Russia a country with a lot of nukes but if they drop nukes which i can almost guarantee that if putin said to launch them someone will shoot him in the head but if they do launch all of nato will screw Russia up i have seen to many people scared of ww3 let me tell you its not gonna start theres 3 ways this end 1 peace talks 2 they do nuke Ukraine and Ukraine surrenders 3 the most likely Russia gives up or someone kills putin,tki2by

"The war begins to approach a stalemate on the ground and in urban areas with the west and most major cities being occupied by Ukraine and most rural areas/the eastern and southern cities occupied by Russia.

Russia senses the stalemate and escalates to larger and larger long range civilian bombings as Ukrainian forces are forced more and more to hide within urban civilian infrastructure. This results in many Ukrainian civilian casualties. The Ukrainian people are beginning to have had enough.

In response to peace talks with Russia, Ukraine holds a vote using their digital platform. A slight majority of voters vote in favor of ending the war. It's agreed upon that the Donbas and Crimea are permanently given to Russia. Ukraine agrees to never join NATO and to only maintain a minimal military force. In return Ukraine can continue to function as they otherwise have been and will remain a recognized country.",tki2by

In my honest opinion this was nothing about Ukraine and all about being a western NATO trap.  Since that's obviously failed he has two choices.

They don‚Äôt have the military spending like the US to poor into proper logistics. 80% of their railways are owned by the Russian military. And in the early days of the war they railway entrances to Ukraine were destroyed. This meant everything has to be brought in by truck. They must have known this would have been an issue since one of their first objectives was the secure an airstrip near Kyiv. The correct military doctrine surrounding logistic is the logistics determines the war, but Russia‚Äôs approach is the war determines logistics.",tc2v9g
Lol the only reports/news you've been watching is from the western pov which is full of propaganda and you are one stupid guy if you take it all in as 100% truth. I am pro ukrainian and don't support russia's action one slight bit. If I was russia why would I use my best/expensive missiles in ukraine when I know very well a bigger war looms around the corner if things go sideways. Russian army budget is much smaller than US/Nato and hence the type of war it wages is dirty and of less precision at the expense of greater loss of men/equipment. Russia has the men power to get this invasion done on a budget and that's what you're seeing. Initial plan did not work and now it's brute force. Killing civilians was not part of the plan from russian side and it's still not (as I beleive they wanted install a pro russian goverment but they can kiss this thought good by) even though there has been many war crimes against civilians such as bombing of the hospital.,tc2v9g

"With respect, that's not an average russian home. I knew working class Russian familes that Iived in these old soviet blocks but still made them look nice. Remember lkea had been operating in Russia for quite a long time. However, they are small and dated fittings wise, washers, ovens, boilers, radiators etc. as these items are very expensive.  This is the reason you see so many Orcs trying to steal white goods.

Check out the many YouTube videos with tours around the average Russian apartment. Quite interesting, but they never look like this shit ole.",v079l1
Russia is a ginormous shit place with some golden palaces and megayachts.,v079l1
"I‚Äôm sad for the women and children who have to live in squalor, I imagine this was a nice apartment but it was never maintained. If Russian men were as proud of their homes as they are of their egos this would not happen.",v079l1
"Seriously, wtf does this have to do with the war",v079l1
These reminds me of the houses when I visit my aunt in Serbia.,v079l1
Sorry guys but this is just dumb Russia bashing.,v079l1
Is this literally what most people live like in russia or an outlier shithole? Hard to believe most people live this way,v079l1
"This is not how average Russian homes look like, most places are in need of renovation but this example is an exaggeration",v079l1
"Now we understand why the Russian population has been flat for 30 years, no one wants to raise children in this.",v079l1
brings back memories,v079l1
No wonder they are pissed off when they get into Ukraine and see how badly they are being ripped off and held back by their scumbag govt and its sychophants,v079l1
"I'm sorry, but how the hell is this related to the ongoing war?",v079l1
That tub be looking like if you left water in it for a few days there'd be new lifeforms evolving in there,v079l1
"Although funny, this isn‚Äôt an accurate portrayal of all Russian homes. Watch Eli from Russia or any of those other Youtubers and you‚Äôll see they have a decent to good amount of taste in interior maintenance and decor.",v079l1
"That‚Äôs not an average Russian home, I‚Äôm not Russian but I have been to Russia. We can cherry pick poverty stricken homes in the USA and tag em as average USA home too.",v079l1
They happily live like this because they are brainwashed to believe that motherland needs more nukes and more military.  That and they are blind to their leaders' corruption - those obligarchs after all work so hard and deserve a second megayacht with 25 golden toilets on board.,v079l1
You guys hating hard on russia citizens it not their fault,v079l1
"Russia = shit

Their culture, industry, and future are all dying behind their Iron-Oxide Curtain‚Ñ¢.

I thought it was improving in 1991, but it turns out that Russians insist on being led by bullies, because true self-government scares them. 

The courageous among them who dare to challenge Putin even in small ways are the only people who can save them from imploding and dying off into fragmented states.",v079l1
"Oh god, you must let those poor soldiers keep those Ukrainian washing machines!!

/s obviously, merciful thing is to make sure they never have to return to those apartments.",v079l1
They have a washing machine!,v079l1
It has an indoor toilet at least. Makes me feel lucky to live where I do.,v079l1
And not a washing machine in sight ....,v079l1
That is why they‚Äôre invading Europe,v079l1
"In many (probably most) parts of russia quite a few items or facilities on this video would be actually considered luxury. 

Of course this is not representative for areas like moscow (even though you could easily find that there, too). But on average, yes, this is not exaggerated at all.",v079l1
"I'm shocked with people. Such an apartment is an exception to the rule. Such living conditions can be found in all countries of the world . YOU are constantly shouting that we have been brainwashed, but you firmly believe that your brains are clean and that you are being told only the truth. The war is terrible, but Ukraine has committed no less war crimes. The US,Britain,France,Germany do not have the right to condemn Russia, it suffices to count the number of their war crimes. Undoubtedly, Putin is a terrible person, but I understand his motivation, but I do not understand the supply of weapons to Ukraine. Europe is a very hypocritical society. Do you really hate everything Russian ? Then remember who saved everyone during the Second World War.",v079l1
I mean that's a pretty nice place tho. The bathroom and kitchen are pretty big and they even have a hallway.,v079l1
"Looks like student dormitory, judging by the number of sinks, the long corridor and materials used on the floor and walls. Yep, high schools in Russia are very poor to be able to provide high living standards to their students.",v079l1
Certified Cringe.,v079l1
"If this is an average russian flat, Putin would've been tarred and feathered a long time ago.",v079l1
Where is the stolen washing machine from Ukraine?,v079l1
All the money spent on this war when there's so much *inside* Russia that could actually use that money.,v079l1
"Ok, you guys obviously don‚Äôt understand art",v079l1
500 000 dollars in NYC,v079l1
It do be kinda spacious.,v079l1
What I see is a russian invasion to gain appliances to replace their current situation,v079l1
Who‚Äôs peeling up all the tiles in Russia,v079l1
Yikes,v079l1
"I would understand a person wanting to die because of this, but the sheer idiotism of the desire to die FOR this will always baffle me.",v079l1
"""Avarage"" russian home?",v079l1
"https://youtu.be/DwjIe_quZ70
Its pretty much the same in USA, i guess thats why them and russia are enemies for so long, they live in that shitholes of apartments and houses so they hate each other because they cannot make society work as it should. I feel really sad for those two nations. I am guite sure there is same houses in every country worldwide so i guess we all live in this kind of shitty places. Fucking matrix",v079l1
I thought they were born from the fucking mud ans muck of the earth... the result of breeding humans and goblins.. no?,v079l1
Definitely not the average Russian home.,v079l1
"Tbh, my house looks like that. At least, I'm sure that's what my mother-in-law thought.",v079l1
And they keep voting for Putin who went from broke to $70 billion while president of Russia. They really deserve to live in a shit hole.,v079l1
"I find it interesting that the Axis powers from World War 2 have some of the largest post-war economies yet Russia who was on the winning side continues to be a shithole backwards country. I hate to use the ‚ÄúR word‚Äù but the Russian people are socially and economically retarded. They can‚Äôt progress and there is something in their culture doesn‚Äôt allow them to move forward. As a westerner, I can‚Äôt comprehend it.",v079l1
No wonder why they‚Äôre always pissed and wanting to fight ‚Ä¶ Geeez ü§®,v079l1
I'm not sure these homes can even handle the washing machines they're stealing.,v079l1
"Ya you guys are animals and deserve to live like animals. Just my opinion, prove me otherwise with all that‚Äôs going on with your silly country.",v079l1
Looks like the flat from Trainspotting where all the Edinburgh junkies lived,v079l1
To good for Mordor orks,v079l1
"What an hyperbole (to use polite words instead of ""utterly biased propaganda""). That's not ""average"" Russia home at all.",v079l1
"I lived in Russia for 12 years. I did see a few nasty places, but this is hardly the ""average"" Russian home.",v079l1
hollowed out water heater looks straight out of Terminator Judgment Day - where the hollowed out TV serves as a fireplace,v079l1

Ukrainian women are so hot,tkeor5
[deleted],tkeor5
"Meh, she's just some eye candy. Have seen a dozen of her pics on here in past weeks, all in clean camo with good makeup, perfectly clean hair, and a come hither look. Ukrainian social media corps pinup girl. They did show her loading bullets into AK mags once, so at least she's seen what they look like.

When i see her with her hair crushed up under a field helmet, no makeup, soggy clothes, muddy boots and filthy pants, belly-down in a ditch overlooking no-man's land holding a rifle, then i'll be impressed. Simp that... lol!",tkeor5
Is that something she is in to? Asking for a friend....,tkeor5

This nazi bitch again? Yawn. Is title implying she fucked Putin lol? Female what now?,tkeor5

However if you want! Continue your support for Ukraine. Other ways you coukd help besides just praying and listening is donating online to trusted sources. Go ti peaceful protests if you have any.

Or just be there ti listen   

Thank you",t1nq15
You don't need to tell you are an Indian,t1nq15
"Because from the outside it certainly seems most Russians either agree with it, or are apathetic to it. If Russians were protesting or at least not openly supporting it en masse, there would be more sympathy, but it seems most Russians think Ukraine shouldn't exist and whatever Russia does to them is justified.

The real victims are the Ukrainian citizens and families and children being killed, not slightly inconvenienced Russians. So I'm sorry, but not much sympathy to send to any Russians right now. That would change if Russians started not openly supporting it.",wkagea
"Russia has brought the Russian world to Europe and it reeks of torture and death. 

Russia brings murder of innocents, torture of civilians, rape of children. And it cheers as it does so, on social media Russians celebrate, they insult the displaced, they threaten the world with nuclear amrageddon whilst simultaneously starving it. 

This is true Russia. And it fucking reeks.

Leave Europe and take your Russian world with you. We want nothing to do with you.",wkagea
"That you complain about sanctions first says enough, fuck your russian money when innocent ukrainians are being slaughtered and tortured.
If you are silent about it, you support it.",wkagea
"Where were the Russian people when Russia illegally invaded Ukraine in 2014 and annexed Crimea?

Where were the Russian people when Russia aided and supplied Donbass separatists in 2014?

Where were the Russian people when Russia allowed those separatists to shoot down a passenger aircraft, MH17, with Russian supplied weapons?

They were standing behind Putin and his plans for remaking the Russian Empire by force. They were supporting his authoritarian regime in destabilizing and surreptitiously annexing neighbors.

You're only tired of this war that has lasted 8 years now because now you aren't doing so well. Now the reality of world-wide condemnation and economic isolation is hurting *you*. If the world had rolled over and given Russia a slap on the wrist on economic sanctions and major corporations were not shamed into pulling out of the country, and if your military wasn't a hollowed out shell pretending to be an effective modernized force in the face of a well-equipped OpFor, you'd probably still be standing behind Putin.

The rest of the world is sick and tired of Russia. Every day your government and media talk about wiping Ukraine off the map and destroying their culture, heritage, and even language. Your politicians talk about killing every Western journalist. Your military openly talks about rigging a nuclear power plant with explosives so if they get ousted, they can blow it up and subject most of Europe to radioactive dust. Your soldiers rape and kill civilians, mutilate and murder POWs, and then lie about it and claim that Ukraine did it to themselves. 

Face it, the Russian people made their bed and now they have to sleep in it. It's gonna get *a lot* worse for you before it gets better. More and more countries are closing their borders to Russians because they don't want people like the Russian tourist in Austria harassing Ukranian refugees there. 

Do something about it. It's gonna be hard, and it's gonna be dangerous, but until Russia changes and gets rid of the fascist, militaristic government with a jingoistic strongman culture that believes itself to be superior to everyone else and relies of threats of nuclear annihilation and illegal invasions to get their way, the majority of the planet is going to shun you. And we will likely continue to shun you, both socially and economically, until your country collapses and a government that can actually play nice with the world takes over. And probably forced nuclear disarmament because I don't think Russia can be trusted not to resort to nukes if they lose enough in Ukraine.",wkagea
"The russian population clearly lost its moral compass. Its time for you to revolt, because you are closer to lose everything than you realize. Putler will kill everybody including you before admitting defeat and resign....

Cant believe I have to say this, but people who cheer for war are not on the good side of history and doesnt deserve to live among the civilized world.",wkagea
"Then get out and do something about it. If you don't actively oppose your government, then you are giving them tacit approval and are complicit in their crimes.",wkagea
"The invasion of Ukraine does not stop with you bitching and whining about it, and wallowing in selfpity. It stops when you, your family and your friends stand up against Putin and his crownies.",wkagea
"Because your state is socially unwell (the Russian condition) Russia is a place of double think,half truths,No one wants to hear what comes out that place anymore.Russia has used up all of its chances ,so no more talking from Russia no ones listening. From what ive seen and heard I think Most of the world has decided that you can longer be allowed to run your own affairs, and that sooner or later Russia will have to be dealt with the hard way and be re-organized. This could happen at some point regardless of the risks involved and I wouldn't be surprised if plans are already in place.",wkagea
"No, the world is fine. It's your country that's sick, its population brainwashed with lies and propaganda with any alternative viewpoints brutally repressed. This is what happens when you have an authoritarian dictator in power. Quit whining and do something about it.",wkagea
"YOUR government represent YOU. 

If the war dosent represent YOU then SPEAK UP!

If YOUR government are killing innocent and YOU stay silent... Then why should i care about YOU!

And the world will hate the Ruzzian orcs for decades... How long time did it take the world to forget Nazi germany? 100 years? 

When putler kills a child, all Ruzzians kill a child... Its very simpel...",wkagea
"I know it's anecdotal, but i am from country bordering russia and spent a lot of time in russian communities for my hobbies and almost everyone who i considered to be friend from russia supported the war and someone even told me that he hopes my country is next so yeah... So maybe ask your neighbours not us.",wkagea
Even Russians hate Russians,wkagea
"Because your country is and has been the cradle of a lot of evil, because Russia is the antagonist of the world, because we've grown and lived under the threat of nuclear annihilation at the hands of... Guess, the Russians, because Russian influence destroys countries, because Ivan Drago killed Apollo Creed, because as a nation, there is no opposition for sending an army to rape babies and bomb civilians. Yes sir. I do hate Russians. 

I hope the war goes south for the regime and Russia can be brought in with the rest of the world instead of being a never ending risk.",wkagea
"Quite simply because RuZZians are complicit by doing nothing, period.",wkagea
"Self pity huh? Not a good look. The next month will not be fun for you. 

The next 5 years will be worse.",wkagea
"nice bait mate , russians are dog eating child raping cowards.  if you were so upset you would have blown up your local police station and started a revolution by now but you'd rather rape children and steal toilets",wkagea
Suddenly realized your side is losing? russia is the biggest shithole on the planet. Fuck off.,wkagea
"Well , that‚Äôs because Russia decided to invade a sovereign country and rape and kill innocent people",wkagea
The world isn't sick. Russia is sick. The tumor is Putin and it is spreading all over the country. The world is the cure with some medicines as treatment: for example sanctions and military aid for UA. The world sooner or later will heal the patient. Only it would be helping if the body (Russian ppl with a little bit common sense left) would coorporate a bit more.,wkagea
"It is always astonishing how distatched the Russian people feel from their government. It is always ""hate only the government"" or ""I am not political"". They do not feel responsible for their government or have the slightest idea of the concept that the government should be run by the people. Russia is truly a dictatorship and the people do not have any concept of democracy.",wkagea
"I don't hate all Russians. I do hate the siloviki. They are what lets this war go on. I also don't feel bad about the army if they are in Ukraine. They shouldn't be there. They are doing horrible things to the Ukrainian people, and this is the only way to get them to stop and leave.",wkagea
"If the US military got sent on a ""special operation"" in Mexico to ""fight the scourge of drug Lords"" in open warfare, the troops would not make it a mile before turning around and wondering WTF. Then our armed populous would make what happened in January look like a Cub Scout meeting.

This says less about America, and more about how morally, culturally, and financially corrupt your country is. Collectively, you've demonstrated an absolutely insane level of callous apathy for not only your neighbor/extended relatives, but your own country as well. Park yourselves next to North Korea and keep the infection to yourselves.",wkagea
"If you fuckers didn‚Äôt illegally invade Ukraine, everything would have been just fine. Also the majority of Russians support Putin. So yeah.. go fuck yourself and rot in hell.",wkagea
![gif](giphy|RBvQaFrHtau1psibrg),wkagea
"Oh you are sick of something your country is doing to others ? Welcome to the real life.

Yes the wars are happening in some countries in Africa and Middle East but whataboutism is not going to work here. How can we stop all wars in the world when we have them started by your country ? You can cry all you want but not doing anything about your government is one of the reason why all of this is happening.

Also yes your country is hated because of years of doing what Russia does best. Bullying weaker countries into compliance. It's not fun sitting in a country bordering you and thinking ""Will the dictator in Russia invade us ?"" or maybe ""Will he annihilate the whole world with the nukes ?"". So go drink your sorrows away or do something to end this war. Silence Is Compliance.

Also those from your country that show the world that they support this war is not a good thing for Russia's image. I have seen at least 1000 people that support this war outside your country and you want to tell me that Russians don't want this war ? Go with those crocodile tears somewhere else, your country is making millions of lives miserable at least you are feeling the same thing as them to some degree.

Edit: And yes I am mad. Russia was never good news for Poland. I don't remember anything positive coming out of Russia towards Poland. Why do you think Poland's main enemy is Russia ? I will give you as much time as you want.",wkagea
Put down your phone and go outside üòÖ,wkagea
Did you just throw a tantrum?,wkagea
"Hard to sympathize for a nation who‚Äôs Ikea lines were larger than its anti war protest.

Russia is on the wrong side of history and I hope they will pay reparations for decades, not only to Ukraine but for every evil it has contributed since 1918. Couple that with a broken culture, fanatic mentality, imperialistic propaganda and last but not least, absolute EVIL psychology; nuclear threats, violent news outlets, children used for Z propaganda, etc etc etc.

Horrible, horrible future for Russia. Seems the cancer inside is about to eradicate its host. Hopefully soon.",wkagea
"Why is this war popular? Well, because it‚Äôs a first ‚Äúreal‚Äù war with a real frontline in a long while. Also because it‚Äôs hilarious how shit russian army actually is.
Why hate every russian? Because most of you fuckers support this war. We hate all of yall just to be sure. If you don‚Äôt support putins regime and can actually prove it then we‚Äôll apologize. Right now it sounds like you‚Äôre one of the angry/crazy russians and just switched tactics from boasting to bitching.",wkagea
"Not many wars are going on at the moment... none nearly as intense (in casualties, equipment committed, economic damage) as what Russia started in Ukraine this year.

If you're sick of the sanctions, blame Russia for 2014 and now 2022. Invade another country without consultation and for no good reason, expect sanctions, explosions, popular disapproval.

Remember when Japan bombed Pearl Harbor? Japanese-Americans in the U.S. were sent to internment camps. Government reflects the will of a good portion of the people (ideally the majority, but not always). If it doesn't where you live, think about why that is, maybe consider changing it.",wkagea
"You're complaining about sanctions and people hating while ukraines are literally dieing and losing their homes. If you want to do something about it, protest against your gov. If mass protests start, the war will likely stop.",wkagea
"""This world is sick. Why is all of this happening?""

Because your leader, your tzar, your fuhrer, your Putler, decided he wanted to invade and conquer Ukraine, and denazify (see: genocide) the Ukrainian people. That is the fuck WHY, you goddam idiot. I don't hate you, i just think you're a prize-winning dumbfuck, if you haven't figured that out yet. smh",wkagea
American here and I hate all Russians. They are a backwards society.,wkagea
(yawn) did you finish?,wkagea
"Nobody wants to live the Russian lifetsyle, you are poor, deluded and have given up your humanity, Putin cannot arrest and kill you all if you all stand up and fight against his Nazi values, but you don't care you are used to being a belonging",wkagea
Because pooteen has finally forced his hand to such a degree that the whole world sees what an evil fucking bastard he is and what a scourge the majority of ruzzian people are. If enough ruzzians hated what he is doing someone or some group would take him out,wkagea
"Not everyone hates all Russians, but when you see videos of Russian citizens acting the way they do towards Ukrainians it just shows. Only one who can stop this is Putin. No one else, he chose this. I am Ukrainian who has Russian friends. None of them go out of there way to talk down on Ukrainians or say how Ukrainians deserves this. I don‚Äôt blame for not going out and protesting or doing other things. Since there will be consequences for them or there family.",wkagea
"Making this post crying about why the world hates Russia. Lol

The war will come back to Russia and the federation will cease. A new better Russia will be born from the ashes.",wkagea
"I'd like to think that most people don't hate ALL Russians. They just hate the Russian government and those who support and fight for it.

As someone from the UK, and this probably shared by many Americans, I hate my own country for its involvement in the Middle East, Iraq, Afghanistan etc.  I marched along with over a million other people through my capital city to oppose the invasion of Iraq back in 2003. So I know what's it's like to not be someone who represents what my country is doing. 

That said, the invasion of Ukraine is an act of imperialist aggression and should be unequivocally opposed. Anyone who is responsible for it, takes part in it or supports it is complicit in genocide.",wkagea
Build yourself a nice little bridge and get the fuck over it.,wkagea
Ya'll guys would celebrate Russian internment camps if had... soon maybe,wkagea
Don't give up. It's gonna get better,wkagea
Lol don‚Äôt worry you‚Äôll be drafted soon and blown up by HIMARS,wkagea
"Russians who condemn Putin‚Äôs terrorist regime and are killed poisoned for it, are heroes",wkagea

"Here‚Äôs the link to them banning me. The mods follow up was even more pathetic high horsing. üòÇ stereotypical mod losers as if they didn‚Äôt let the sub go to complete shit right at the onset of the war.

"Related experience in YouTube...

I got pummeled today in YouTube after posting a short informative comment under someone's military analysis on the Ukraine war.

I wanted to write a post in r/Ukraine to vent my anger, but decided not to. What would it change? It's not as if we can (or want to) shut YouTube down.

It seems to me that YouTube is the least managed of all social networks, and it is attracting the very worst of mankind.

A significant subculture on YouTube seems to get horny whenever they see Russian weapons blowing up things. I don't have another way of describing it. It's some kind of sick sexual fantasy about long cannons, killing, and brutal domination.

I routinely get threats in YouTube. Public or private. People who wish me dead, or who post insults. Reporting doesn't work. YouTube doesn't care. Not a single report was effective, it always ends up with ""thanks for reporting but XYZ is respecting the community's standards"".

I once received threats after posting a video of myself cooking a duck breast in a pan. I got called names for posting a comment about shepherd pie. Someone suggested I should return under the rock where I usually hide.

So imagine what kind of messages I got after posting a short message regarding Ukraine's military operations near Kharkiv.

People calling for Zelensky to be hanged seems to follow community standards in YouTube. Celebrating the bombing of children is okay too. Hoping for more genocide, no issue. As is calling me a fucking moron, or wondering if I am a crack addict, or asking when I will kill myself out of shame.

It all follows YouTube standards.

YouTube is filled to the brim with Russian military apologists, propagandists, and extremely aggressive and mean people who know they will not be banned, unless they post contents with very very specific keywords on specific topics.",u7ev46
Same I've got screenshots. When questioned I was muted for 28 days,u7ev46
"I know, I saw the transition from a good sub to utter garbage slowly over these past few months.",u7ev46
Lots of assholes in that sub anyways,u7ev46
"They're not pandering to it they're just not letting people from this sub and others going there and calling every russian video thats posted propaganda  and the posters bots. They appreciate seeing both sides of the story

I've been a member of that sub for a long time and im glad they're doing there best to make the sub turn to shit.",u7ev46
"Yep, I got banned for calling the Kadyrovite tiktokers LARPing little bitches...",u7ev46
They did the same to me,u7ev46
Which post is it?,u7ev46
I wouldn't alledge they are pro Russian I think they like to keep the sub out of politics and nationalist setiments and just keep it unbiased combat footage.,u7ev46
[deleted],u7ev46
I did the same and got banned too lol.....same with tankporn,u7ev46
I couldn't even figure out why they hell they banned me. I wasn't even close to extreme or indecent in any way. All I could guess was that I kept making negative comments about Russians? Wild,u7ev46
They also blocked/banned me for reporting misinformation and calling out Russian bots. The place is a cesspool of Russian and Chinese bots and misinformation.,u7ev46
Doesn‚Äôt look very pro Russian in there to me. You sure you weren‚Äôt just being a dick?,u7ev46
"I dont think this is true at all, I posted an Azov video on their sub yesterday, 97% upvote and 5k upvotes. Maybe a power tripping mod or you were being disrespectful but the sub itself is very much not pro-Russian. In fact I posted the same video on this sub and it get less upvote at 95%.",u7ev46
What are you talking about? combatfootag is posting russian footage too while this sub is almost 100% ukrainian footage. And not everyone you want to be a russian bot is one...,u7ev46
I disagree. Hopped on a video of some chechen dumbfuck getting hit while standing on a open intersection during a firefight and the comments were full of people laughing and joking at his stupidity.,u7ev46
Same keeps happening to me!!!,u7ev46
"They banned me too, yes it appears so.",u7ev46
"Who banned you and why? Is the moderator Russian? ""Hey this is a bot"" -> Banned?? Yes there is more propaganda on that reddit channel but is it compromised, anyone can vote. And by the comments the Russians here are fucked, better to stay on VK social media.",u7ev46
Yea same thing happened to me. Haven‚Äôt been able to go to that sub in weeks because I called out an account that kept posting false pro-Russian information. Really sucks because that was one of my favorite subs to see updated unfiltered info on the war,u7ev46
.,u7ev46
"They banned me for being happy Azov is being dismantled. I think they got a mess of mods with opposing viewpoints, not a single one of them healthy.",u7ev46
r/morbidreality ‚Äòs mods are nazi sympathizers.,u7ev46
Being banned or censored on Reddit is something you have to accept. It happens to me frequently,u7ev46
I generally try and give my most obnoxious pro Ukrainian message I can as loud as I can on Combat Footage. I mock their troop movements and their feeble attempts at pretending to be a first rate military while shitting on human rights. I feel guilty I can‚Äôt do more as innocent women and children die.,u7ev46
"Yeah, i was banned from r/GunFights because a warned the people about a video posted in a site full of porn and viruses, probably a scam running by the mods, since all allowed links are like that now!",u7ev46
"Same thing on FB. I got a month long suspension for posting video of Russian war crimes and calling Russians dicks. 

Social media platforms all protect them and allow the spread of their lies and disinformation. Wait till Mr Free Speech takes over Twitter.",u7ev46
Sorry if this is a stupid question: Is a bot an actual person posting or is it an instant computer generated response?,u7ev46
"I unsubscribed from that sub weeks ago.  Too many trolls, not enough moderation.",u7ev46
"Calling everything that posts misinformation as a ""bot"" is ubiquitous, inaccurate, and very annoying.",u7ev46
"I think the bigger issue is subreddits that don‚Äôt allow full speech on both sides. Combat footage is the rare unicorn that allows Russian and Ukraine footage, without all the politics and white knights simping for one side.",u7ev46
"..And I was banned from /r/Ukraine for not supporting Israel. 
Mods are trash on every subreddit, they have no oversight and are free to ban over any personal reason they want. It is the worst thing about this platform.",u7ev46
"I got a permanent ban, hence the new account, for suggesting Russian invaders should be killed... Inciting violence",u7ev46
Not only this one. There are other subs who protect smol pp rusia and rusian orcs,u7ev46
"Bullshit! They kicked me out whenever I questioned footage from Ukrainians. They called me a Russian bot and kicked me out. No chance to explain, appeal, nothing. There's no free speech!",u7ev46
"r/TankPorn is damn close to that point.

For anything truly, demonstrably false and/or misleading you can report it to reddit admins. I think I've made maybe 1 report in the years I've been on reddit up until the last several weeks. When the former mod of UkraineVideoReport was taking patron and actively promoting pro-russian posts I made nearly a dozen. They have a very strong anti-propaganda stance.",u7ev46
"It‚Äôs not pandering, they just don‚Äôt want arguments in the comments about the morality of the war, it‚Äôs a footage sub not a political forum",u7ev46
Agree. Ruskie bot suspended me for being too mean to Putin enablers.  Waaaaa,u7ev46
"I would have to disagree that the mentioned sub panders to pro-Russians. That sub acknowledges the existence of Ukrainian and Russian propaganda, but the last thing they want are comments related to ""Us vs Them"". This included labels such as 'Russian Bots' and such.

Edit: spelling correction",u7ev46
Seems like bullshit,u7ev46
"There definitely are, there was someone upvoted fairly well for peddling the Kremlin RT line talking about how donbass is being shelled by nazis for years and ‚Äúthe OSCE ignored them‚Äù. I simply responded with a picture of the OSCE observers Girkin/Strelkov and his DPR thugs kidnapped and tortured and held in the same room (photographed) that he then held a meeting in, showing the complicity was right to the top.

The idiot shill didn‚Äôt respond.

On top of that there was another person his whole comment history was manipulative saying anything good news about Ukraine must be fake, or any breaking news ( a lot of later proven true such as the Moskva sinking) ‚Äú is likely Ukrainian propaganda‚Äù but always doing it carefully acting impartial and always acting like he‚Äôs ‚Äújust being impartial‚Äù but trheee was a few comments in his history where he let it slip, when he‚Äôd do stuff like go ‚Äú Hahha so you think they sunk all Russias ships!l and then he actually got downvoted.

So you could see he learned to make sure to be more careful about it as in other comments he always made sure to play into the believable circle jerk of ‚Äú Ukrainians are lying and exaggerating blah blah‚Äù

I made a post and I realised there were bots there when they immediately got a post I know definitely had never been posted there before taken down as ‚Äú overreported‚Äù.

It was brazen. 

And they made nasty comments like calling a Ukrainian rape victim ‚Äú a thot‚Äù and ‚Äú let be honest maybe she looking for favours‚Äù in broken English.


I think a lot are straight up refugees from genzedong along with pro Russian telegram users.

It seems that pro Russian fanatics go anywhere that is even mildly neutral and see it as a collecting place like moths to a flame and start flooding it.",u7ev46
Most of the videos on there are pro Russian,u7ev46
"I got banned twice in this sub, just cause I wished bad to Putin and Ivans.  Oh well.",u7ev46
I‚Äôm always suspicious of anything that would help Russia or China in anyway shape or form. I‚Äôve noticed how there‚Äôs the ‚Äúoh I‚Äôm neutral‚Äù crowd that will regurgitate Russian propaganda. Sometimes they‚Äôll be even more subtle such as those who advocate for isolationism or other forms of disintegrating the free world.,u7ev46
I've been banned twice. Apparently for hate speech when I said something about Kadyrov Chechens and for calling Russian Army warcriminal. Yeah it's a pro Russian sub. Tries to pretend it's not but it is.,u7ev46
"Yeah gotta agree with you on this one, I have been actively following that sub for years and the tankies and comieboos have gotten really bad since the Russian invasion.

There were a few during Syria but pretty obvious but now it is ridiculous",u7ev46
"Fuck combatfootage. They banned me for a day (I think) for cheering about that helicopter brought down over a field (the epic one, when the invasion was starting). A russian propagandist got mad at me for being happy about it.

I unsubbed right then and there. We'll still cheering here, damned orcs!",u7ev46
"Now you see how conservatives feel in social media. I disagree the banning based on the ground of trolling or hate speech.

Free speech is free speech. Let them say whatever they want. You don‚Äôt have to silence them to prove anything.",u7ev46
I call out the Russian bots there all the time and I‚Äôve never been banned lol,u7ev46
Stfu we don't have to watch videos only from Ukrainian side,u7ev46
Yup me too.,u7ev46
It‚Äôs ‚Äúcombat footage‚Äù tho,u7ev46
Troll the Orcs time.,u7ev46
"It was pretty obvious to me, too.",u7ev46
"That forum is less subjective and is only interested in information rather than opinions, i am on your side but thats what i would say.",u7ev46
free speech right? why complain?,u7ev46
Me watch things go boom.,u7ev46
I‚Äôm sure it has nothing to do with your tit for tat arguing and behavior like this over a 7 day ban lol.,u7ev46
Not surprising. I‚Äôm getting super choked at all the dipshits commenting myself.,u7ev46
"Yep. I got a week ban for arguing with people that although Azov has reprehensible views about many things, they're the most motivated fighting force in the Ukrainian military at the moment and what they're doing in Mariupol is the definition of heroic. They banned me 15 minutes after I posted that comment and when I asked the mods why they said that I was being a ""Nazi sympathizer"".


..... Like in the comment I got banned for, I prefaced with I said by saying that Azov's views on many things are fucked up, no doubt, but we should appreciate that we have men like that willing to fight and die for Ukraine. It actually blew my mind that they banned me for that. First time that's ever happened to me on any subreddit in general.",u7ev46
"That sub is not meant for political discussion, its pure footage, nothing more.",u7ev46
"I believe the expression you‚Äôre looking for is, ‚ÄúREEEEEEE‚Äù.",u7ev46
"Not really but mkay,you do you...",u7ev46
"Before the Ukraine War combat footage was a purely nonpolitical sub. They are trying to maintain that/ balance stuff right now. 

The mods have expressed frustration about this topic frequently. Another sub I follow closed completely because of the issue/some stuff",u7ev46
"I just got perma banned without explanation, when i asked they muted me . Obvious russian shills",u7ev46
Have you considered posting it as an educational film on how Sunflower fertilizer is made?,u7ev46
They're making the sub so horrible that it's useless.,u7ev46
just don't go there then,u7ev46

The rest of the world including many Russians want him dead,tgraiq
"At this point, we don‚Äôt care what Putin wants. We want him deposed and the invasion to end. Fuck whatever he wants.",tgraiq
"The question is that why does his inner circle want to stay with him and go down to history as people who caused the decline of Russia? At this stage it's clear that Putin can't win. By winning I mean getting a favourable peace deal in Ukraine and everything going back to normal. 

At best he can have a dishonourable retreat and huge cost of rebuilding Ukraine taken from the frozen Russian funds. 

At worst he'll have a new Afghanistan with 10 times more casualties and crippling sanctions on Russia for years. 

Neither of these scenarios will be seen favourably by the Russian people and they won't take forever to get rid of him. 

So why don't those people close to him rise up now and salvage whatever is to be salvaged to themselves?",tgraiq

"Nationalism goes both ways. If the Ukrainians didn't have nationalism/patriotism they would have no reason to defend their country. Become a citizen of Russia if there is no difference.

It was religion throughout the history making this.

After people stop taking religion to seriously, it got replaced with nationalism. Nationalism is a threat to world-peace.

"It has been ‚Äúfun‚Äù (actually quite sad) to go to one of the officially sanctioned Russian state news sites (ria.ru, for example), turn on live translate, and see what is being spoon fed to the Russian public as the truth.

It is so insane that the media just parrots what Putin tells them too. I hope the Russia public is too smart to fall for that. I was too young to remember the Soviet Union but this ban on open news seems like a shift back to then.

As much as I hate politics in the US for how divisive it has gotten, this is nothing to what is going on in Russia.",tcmeuk

"lets pretend putin gives the order and he has henchmen with guns pointed at the wives and children of the others who has to ok the order.

putins choice here is what kind of nukes to use,he knows the shit storm that is coming after he uses it,so why use a small scale warhead? it wouldnt do much,and why use only one? he has to assume nato will hit him hard,so then he might as well launch all he can.

and if he does know nato will strike back he knows he wont get a second launch so he must strike the entire west while he can.

so what he has to do is destroy all capitals in the west he has to annihilate all major cities in ukraine.

the same second his launch silos go active nato counter launches.

all subs launches.

every country hostile to nato also launches.

russia is gone large parts of the world dies.

the world economy collapses.

the survivors now live in the middle ages.

thats what would happen.

And in what way would putin win that war? so whats the point?

A nuke wont win the war for him in ukraine,so it would be to either punish ukraine for his failure or to say fuck it im old and dont have a future anyway.

But for that he could use bio weapons or nerve gas,its like ww1 tech and wont give away his move ahead of time.

The problem for putin is if he gives the order and his people says no,thats the end of him,so i think bio och chemical weapons would carry less risks for him personally.",xkyunk

"Plans to neutralize as many Russian nukes as possible before they leave the ground would come closer to fruition. At the point Russia uses nuclear weapons, the economic harm to the world economy would be so disastrous that it would constitute a declaration of war.

I think (I hope) China would back away from Russia and I hope that Russians would openly revolt. I'd give it a few days after the use of a nuclear weapon to see what happens.

But we would for sure be getting ready for a first strike contingency. There is no doubt at that point that Russia poses a threat to the world and should be disarmed by force perhaps even including nuclear force. 

If we allow one nuclear weapon to be used against Ukraine, what about two or three or 10?

Maybe a nuclear weapon should be loaded into starship and it detonated over Moscow prior to any preemptive strike. I dunno. It's terrifying but Russia has created this path.",xkyunk
"Id like to imagine NATO, specifically the US&UK have some super stealthy Trident nuclear armed submarines & other civilization-ending weapons lurking somewhere off the northern russian coast in the Arctic ocean near Murmansk. Incase Russia does somehow nuke and destroy all nuclear armed nato members nuclear forces, there will be an ace in the sleeve. St Petersburg and Moscow, the only real Russian major cities that are wealthy, would be annihilated within minutes of any launch.

"Those troops need to be fed and supplied, in winter, under Ukrainian artillery, targets selected based on western intelligence.

It probably works in Putin's dreams, but it's going to be a massacre in the battlefield.",xnfiq9
"My guess is that he is desperate to hold onto what he has and thus salvage some sort of victory out of this mess (and his neck).

It won't work.

See, the amount of manpower needed to hold against the Ukrainians will need to be fed, watered, and supplied. Russia can't do that even when their supply lines and depots aren't being wiped out on the regular.

With the precision artillery of the Ukraine military, it just won't happen. 

See, there is no magic deadline for the Ukrainians. They can go as long as they want to go and they will be supplied as long as they want to fight, at least by the US. They are masters of attrition warfare and will just grind the Russian frontline indefinitely. Every month they will receive more and better artillery and ammunition and Russia is already sliding back in time as they dig deeper and deeper into stocks that most nations would have scrapped decades ago.

The constant pressure that the Ukrainians *will* apply plus the effect of sanctions on Russia's industrial base is a recipe for failure.

The US doesn't have to escalate. All it has to do is keep the supplies flowing. 

The ""decision"" to be made is exactly how many Russians does Putin want to sacrifice before he calls it quits. My personal hope is he keeps going until the Russian trolls that clog up this board and others are ripped from their gaming chairs and pee bottles and slaughtered en masse.",xnfiq9
"In the bigger picture, the Russians have major issues.

1. The world is heading into a global recession, and demand for Russian exports will simply dry up. Russian oil costs $30-40 per barrel to produce and possibly more now that western experts, financing, and equipment have left. They are also selling at a discount of about $30. Oil is now down below $80 a barrel and only heading lower. Russia will soon be burning through currency reserves at an alarming rate.
2. If they cannot sell their oil and are forced to idle their wells, this is crisis time in the winter. The well heads can freeze without flow. This happened when the USSR collapsed, and they are only now just getting the last of those wells back online (with all that help from the west, Shell, BP, Exon, etc.)
3. Russia (actually Ukraine also) is facing a demographic catastrophe. Losing 100's thousands of young is going to be a big problem. They already barely have the people to fill the workforce (check the unemployment rate) critical parts of the infrastructure and economy could collapse.

Ultimately as long as the west doesn't get bored and walk away (this is no sure thing), Russia will have to fold they simply will not be able to sustain 1.5million men on the front lines for the long haul.",xnfiq9

">Will Ukraine be able to break this frontline? Well, they will need a lot of tanks and aviation to do that. Which they lack. Ukraine has much less tanks and jets than Russia, and there are no announced deliveries of them from the NATO countries.

I disagree slightly, though I do see a frozen conflict approaching. I don't disagree one bit about sending heavier weapons to Ukraine, though, I've argued that for months and time was wasted. 

But simply feeding and resupplying that many men will tax the Russians logistic abilities and we've seen during the war how terrible they are at it. Also, they lock themselves into a defensive war for a long time,  wasting men and resources they could otherwise use to rebuild a proper army.

The Russians don't have an answer to HIMARS and they're outranged by many NATO artillery systems. Given Russia's threats it looks like a frozen conflict, but it'll probably favour Ukraine, not Russia. Political instability, all that.",xnfiq9

"Might be a stretch, but it could be a psychological weapon too.

When I was doing my NCO training in the air force, we had a week of 'hell' kinda exercise. Basically it was the same amount and food and sleep I normally experience in a day stretched across a week of physically and mentally straining tasks. I lost 12kg that week and even fell asleep while marching one night.

After this, we loaded on buses to take us home to our base (1hr drive). I've never slept so good. 

When we got off the bus, feeling relief that the exercise was over - the commander announced he was not satisfied with the exercise and told us to march away from the base to a nearby hill and set up camp. After a few hours, the commander said we were arranging physical endurance and strength tests and needed volunteers to run a 3k and do max situp/hangup/pushups.

We lined up in our gear with startnumbers and everything, and just as the whistle was about to sound they called off the exercise and brought us a coke and piece of cake.

Those last few hours after we got off the bus were almost worse than the entire week due to the psychological stress of thinking it wasn't going to end.


Tl;dr, it could be a huge flex to scare off Putin's enemies from continuing. 300.000 sounds like 50k x 6, meaning the war could drag on for 6x the time it already has. The Kharkiv counteroffensive may have sparked hope that the war will end soon, but Putin can't allow that impression to linger.

Russian troops also need a psychological boost of hearing 300k reinforcements are underway. I don't picture 300k ever making it to the frontlines. Just imagine the required logistics of that.",xnfiq9

">Does Russia plan to start a massive offensive and seize all Ukraine's territory?

Yes. Not this winter, maybe not for a couple years. But the goal is all of Ukraine. Taking Donbas and souther Ukraine is just a staging ground.

Then after that probably Moldovia. I think Putins insane enough to think NATO won't do anything, so maybe planning on the Baltics. This is a decades long plan. 

But, Russia will probably fold before they even take all of eastern Ukraine.",xnfiq9
"Many good discussions going on here, i might add what I think is going on. Please correct me if im wrong, im no expert on The matter.

Putler & co finally realize this is not a war russia win... all The lies, all The treaths... The world is still stubbornly oppose this madness. 
Soo... utter defeat, humiliation and putlers head on a plate... OR make fake referendums is occupied areas and even if everyone knows its a sham add that territory to russia claiming legality.

Then use russias nuclear doktrine as a last attempt to deter ukraine and The west from taking back crimea, Luhansk and Donetsk... saying since those areas are russian territory they would use nukes to defend russia.

Im unsure if The russians are actually crazy enough to use nukes, its most Likely a last desperate bluff but Who knows. They need to add that territory fast for this to work in their favor since they loose utterly on The battlefield.

Question is, Will ukraine and The west be deterred?
If russia learn that nuklear threats work then we Will see alot of The same situations in The future...
Russia have done this for decades.... its time for The world to teach russia to stay behind their own borders and leave others alone... that is in my opinion The only way for my kids to live in a future world of stability.",xnfiq9
"The front line shifts every day, lots of places that were the front line last week have already collapsed.

So, no.

Also, ""they'll get training"" dovetails nicely with, ""they already have combat experience, they already had training."" They don't have trainers or training facilities for even a fraction of those people. Russia always lies, but they're always as they plainly appear, too. They're not sophisticated enough for believable lies. 1+1 always equals 2. They're conscripting people they can't train, they're claiming that they already have training, even though many do not. Equals, they're being sent directly to the front this week, they're not waiting 2 weeks for mythical training that there isn't even infrastructure for.

The lines are already collapsing, and they'll join heavily depleted units as replacements. It won't help all that much, because stronghold areas are getting encircled. Piercing the front lines is not hard when they're 1300km long. That's a thin line. Some places still have defense in depth, but that's getting weaker every day. Other places already don't, which is why Sept 24th was such a big day for Ukraine in the NE. You imagine Ukraine would need something they don't already have... to do what they've already done.

Sorry Ivan. I know it hard to understand that Russia is a small, weak country. So these wild theories pop up. You're in the denial stage of mourning.",xnfiq9
"If Ukraine wiped the floor with somewhat actual trained grown men, what do you think they'll do to a bunch of teens?",xnfiq9
"Weather is changing now. A few limited adjustments until Nov. And then winter defensive positions under artillery and air attacks until end of March.

This will give russians time to re-arm and train. But it will crush their economy and logistics systems.

For Ukraine the worry is maintaining western support during undynamic months and with a disgruntled russian populace,  a great opportunity for unconventional warfare against the Putin regime.",xnfiq9
This is Fox News talking ‚úãüõë,xnfiq9
Forget large heavy NATO tanks for now the ground in this part of Ukraine might not be able to support them again until late spring think about what happened to Russia last February.

"While it's not what we want to hear,, it is what it is. If all you were to get is great news (when it's not) then we are know better than them. We can only hope soon things change in our favor and truth be told there is many signs it could be something thats going to happen in the very near future.

Now I am a (gulf war) vet but I am not there so this is speculation ! I always thought they were there in Severodonetsk to inflict maximum collateral damage to the enemy. I always assumed they would retreat at some point. I would of liked to have seen more reported causalities from the Russian side but so be it. They (the Ukrainians)  did hold them for a while and I hope somehow this works in their favor. Not sure but perhaps.  But what do I know is my hope is genuine that  somehow , someway,  that Ukraine gets all its land back !  

I appreciate getting news even if its not Wins for our team because we have a true picture of what's really happening !",vjw81h

By falling back they can fall back across a river on to hills to much stronger and likely prepared positions. 

Even ignoring that it's on a huge salient that risks being cut off.  

It's only ""vital"" to the Russians who want to control all of Luhansk - but they want more than that anyway. I, and others, assumed from the start it was just a way to bleed the Russians with a defendable location as you *know* they want it so will fight for it. So why not make them pay for it, then retreat to fight again.",vjw81h

From the ‚Äúliberation‚Äù of Europe/ww2 to gangraping pregnant Chechen women to Syria, and sadly now also Ukraine.",tsbctd

Diseased whore! Wait until you have children. Will it be ok for them to get raped by your enemy? Thought not! Stupid girl.,tsbctd

There are idiots. There are defensive mechanisms, which tell you to join the aggressor, when  the reality is too scary . Vast majority of my friends are against of what is happening. Just a couple of people who I know are supporting that, but they are watching tv and believe it. Many people don't know any languages and never been abroad. The majority of people.

"Yeah‚Ä¶ I tried that on my canvas sides HMMWV in Iraq in 2003‚Ä¶ all that did was slow rounds down so that when they hit you, it caused more damage.",y0xear
Good plan.  Add enough of these and the vehicle will get so heavy its suspension and drive train will break on the way to battle.  Also the extra weight will really help it get through those mud holes that the rains are creating.  Either way you do not make it to battle and live after running away bravely. Then someone from the Ukrainian side either captures it or puts a ATGM into it and one more Russian vehicle down,y0xear

"Its instructive to listen to what the oil companies themselves are saying in thier quarterly investment meetings.  They have essentially said in ceo speak ""why the heck should we invest in more wells, in the usa for example, when we are making plenty of money with no risk at all"".  They are afraid of China going into lock down completely and that basically plunging the market down to where in was in 2020.  But right now they are making lots of money, with no risk.  They will not change that anytime soon.",umn6xo

"Uhmmm, energy prices where soaring for a while before all this happened.",umn6xo

"I‚Äôm a realist, I call bullshit when I see it. Just look at the CPI chart. It was going up a month after you were elected.",umn6xo
We had 40 year high inflation in 2021 and this clown blames Putin. Putin only made the 40 year high inflation worse.,umn6xo
"Unfortunately, Putin did not mismanage our economy prior to the invasion of Ukraine, if only Biden could get off that easy.

But yeah, disruption of major industry and produce is going to have a very negative effect and the pain has just started from the Russia thing.",umn6xo
Could blame the oil cartel pretty sure their low output has something to do with it...,umn6xo
"So this is about the eighth excuse for inflation.   
1. There is no inflation.  
2. There is inflation but it‚Äôs only transitory.  
3. Inflation is a ‚Äòhigh class problem‚Äô
4. Inflation is caused by meat producers 
5. It‚Äôs caused by COVID
6. It‚Äôs caused by the ‚Äòprice gouging‚Äô of big greedy corporations 
7. It‚Äôs the fault of the oil producers
8. It started on 24th February and it‚Äôs the ‚ÄòPutin Price Hike‚Äô

It‚Äôs lucky that they didn‚Äôt spunk countless trillions of created dollars into an economy which didn‚Äôt have the output to meet the demand, because obviously even they realise that this would have inflationary consequences.",umn6xo
Scary part is that so many people will believe this nonsense.,umn6xo
I hate this motherfucker.  There can‚Äôt be any way people actually believe this shit.,umn6xo
What a clown üòÇ Doesn't want to take the responsibility. Gas prices have been going up since Biden took office. Food prices have been soaring and the shelves have been empty. GTFO with all this bullshit. Biden did it and we all know it.,umn6xo
Lame duck dimentia dildo.,umn6xo
"Post covid pent up demand led to some of the highest GDP growth the US has ever seen. At the same time, manufacturers got caught flat footed - having downsized over the previous 2 years and the supply chain suffered. Higher demand and less supply = higher prices. That's not saying that many industries tightened supplies on chips, commodities, materials, etc to drive up prices. They did. The president has very little to do with the price of oil or the CPI. It's a global market. And yes, add a war in the middle of Europe - that doesn't help anything. Putin intentionally meant to screw things up. He's been preparing for this the last 8 years.",umn6xo

Its also because the Saudis won‚Äôt increase production because for some reason the US loves sucking Saudi Arabia‚Äôs dick while they blow up Yemeni people with our own bombs and starve millions more. Can‚Äôt live without our oil! Even if it‚Äôs drenched in the blood of millions!,umn6xo
"The real reason is the corruption that was allowed to continue after the 2008 recession until we formed a bubble so large it's impossible to maintain any longer...but I'm against Putin/Russia for what they have done/are doing so, you're right Joe. Fuck Putin.",umn6xo
Thanks Saudi Arabia for wanting US military to keep your country safe but you can‚Äôt offset oil prices. Just wait. Every dog has its day and yours is coming.,umn6xo
Guess it's tRump that let his pUtin problem into USA.,umn6xo
He‚Äôs a liar.  They all are.  They are doing this to us.  They are manipulating the world.,umn6xo
That‚Äôs not true. Look up when US inflation started and when the build up on the Ukrainian border started. This has not that much to do with putin but with the fact that biden is printing money as if he doesn‚Äôt understand economics,umn6xo
Xi deserves plenty of blame too.,umn6xo
He always scratches his nose when he's about to lie.,umn6xo
It probably had more to do with us printing money like it's our job the last few years.,umn6xo
"Fuck him, we‚Äôve had inflation issues long before this war. Cost of living has been shooting up for the last 20 years with little to no change in federal minimum wage. THE PROBLEM IS BIG BUSINESS AND 99.99% of the politicians, not Putin. But fuck Putin too..",umn6xo
What a load of crap.,umn6xo
"This is called the manufacturing of consent. Despite oil and gas companies having record profits, the blame is put on an enemy target, in this case Putin. The various media outlets will comply and run with the story to detract from the fact that oil and gas companies are profiting while the industrial military complex attempts to generate public consent for another endless war.",umn6xo
What a clown,umn6xo
"Lmaoooo what a joke, prices were already going up before all this happened!! Since he went into office!!",umn6xo
"it's really sad that anyone believes this guy, blatant lies and the media is SILENT",umn6xo

We'd have cheaper gas in the US if this dude continued the pipe line so we didn't have to rely on others for it for some reason,umn6xo
Straight up lying,umn6xo
Gas prices in the US went up the day he took office - when he unilaterally stopped US oil production with a stoke of a pen. Putin today is just a convenient  villain for Biden failed internal policies for the people.,umn6xo
"The Jobless rate is extremely low in the USA. Energy prices are up in large part due to what Putin has done. Coupled with that, at the height of the pandemic energy use was much lower and suppliers cut back on their workforce and output. Now a situation of hurry up and catch up on that. We also have corporations cashing in on inflation by artificially raising prices for increased profit while at the same time keeping the common worker's wages static. I know people love to hate that old man for being old and sounding a bit befuddled at times but he HAS been doing a good job. Then again that view also relates to your own political bias. Such as mine, here ;-)",umn6xo
"The previous president spent 7 trillion dollars in 4 years, over half of that in the last two. Of course we're feeling inflation now. It's dangerous to tie economic misfortunes to Putin, because it pushes for people to want to reconcile in order to fix the economic problems.  Putin needs to fall.",umn6xo
He represents many people that want oil gone. Period. There is no denying their hostility to fossil fuels. Just own it. For better or worse.,umn6xo
He is deflecting‚Ä¶,umn6xo
Com on man. You are doing great just sign the papers and read the the transcript.  We still have another 2 years. You can do it. Stick with the plan.,umn6xo
What about your watered down shovel ready pork barrel spending bill Biden ??? also your shovel ready üëåüèªinfrastructureüëåüèª bill,umn6xo
"Lot of dumb comments here. Biden isn‚Äôt entirely wrong, they are contributing factors but most of the inflation is from the corporate handouts and money printing under Trump which takes time to materialize. That plus record profit margins from corporations, further tax cuts to corporations, wage stagflation, supply chain issues, essentially 6 years of no or low interest debt. Lotta factors but Russia/Ukraine is exasperating the crisis. One thing Biden won‚Äôt blame is Saudi Arabia for not increasing supply to offset the Russians. Why would the saudis, they only get richer selling oil for more money. USA gas refiners/producers are recording astounding record profits right now too. It‚Äôs truly disgusting to blame this on anything but the corporate and political class. Why would Biden blame his class when he could easily blame Putin for everything.",umn6xo
Only strated going up shortly after Biden took office. Must be Putin.,umn6xo
Cap,umn6xo
Very convenient! Not like the Fed just printed 80% of the total money supply in the last 2 years! Of course its Putin!,umn6xo
Or the printing of so much money on last 2 years. Wasn't it like 50% of all money,umn6xo
"LMAO, BIDEN IS A WALKING MEME",umn6xo
"Joe Bidden is the Joker , he just wild carded us",umn6xo

Sure it's not because of the enormous amount of cut paper Biden printed since the beginning of his presidency.,umn6xo
Hello pandemic China is shit down these oil companies need to start paying taxes record profits again for the first quarter don't blame Biden Trump made a deal with opec to decrease production during the pandemic because gas was too cheap wake the fuck up stop suck Trumps ding done take it out of your butt and educate yourself,umn6xo

No it's  Bidens fault. Should of stayed out of Europe we don't want or need the prick here or your weapons and war mongering ways.Stay and fix America your tax payer's want and need it. Don't believe the hype.,umn6xo

The keyboard economist of Dunning Kruger University are alive and well I see in the comments....,umn6xo
Biden is to blame also.,umn6xo
I get so proud of this man when he finishes a sentence,umn6xo
Blaming Putin for a failing domestic agenda is lame although I can't fault the current administration for Lend-Lease even if it comes at the speed of Government. Also not easing the restrictions that would allow the US to stop gap the energy needs of Europe is still a major concern. I guess even a blind pig can find a truffle.,umn6xo
Except prices especially gas prices were high before even began. Dems are blaming Putin for their failure‚Ä¶..but nice try,umn6xo

This was happening long before Ukraine. Him Blaming Pootin is a cop out.,umn6xo

The shamelessly greedy oil barons needs to make record profits before the collapse of humanity (not sure why if we're all dead but anyhoo) and are probably very happy Putin is being used as a scapegoat. This is bullshit.,umn6xo
"While prices were already well on their way up, he isn't totally wrong. It's like a soft lie.",umn6xo
A politician never lets a good tragedy go to waste.,umn6xo

"Sometimes leaders like to blame others for their problems - instead of, say, the trillions of imaginary cash pumped into the economy over the last few years. Putin is a factor, but it‚Äôs pretty disgraceful to make excuses like this.

We need to dig up Milton Friedman and reanimate his corpse‚Ä¶ he can explain to the MAGA crowd and Democrats alike how inflation works, and why their own team captains are at fault. People who believe one party is right and the other is wrong are as susceptible to brainwashing as Zwastika-waving Rascists.",umn6xo

Fuel prices rose from the day he was elected due to his zealous anti-fossil fuel campaign causing speculation of shortages. 

His first EO was to kill KXL and then he **illegally** banned new leases. 

This caused transportation prices to skyrocket, which affected the price of everything.

Inflation and high fuel prices were problems long before Putin did anything.

He is blaming Putin and oil companies to try to salvage his party in the midterms.",umn6xo
How about doing something about it instead of blaming someone for it. So maybe it is Putin.. Does blaming him solve the problem. He's not elected to point fingers but to fix things.,umn6xo

Jesse Benton faces between 5 and 20 years in prison if convicted""

""A former campaign staffer and the grandson-in-law of US Senator Rand Paul who received a presidential pardon from former President Donald Trump has been charged with directing Russian money into the 2016 presidential election, according to the US Department of Justice.  
The announcement came on Monday via an unseal indictment from 9 September.

(The day of Trump‚Äôs conference in Helsinki, Ron Paul told RT that the president‚Äôs friendly attitude toward Vladimir Putin was ‚Äúgreat,‚Äù adding, ‚Äú\[the\] best step ever‚Äù would be ‚Äúgetting rid of the sanctions on Russia.‚Äù) Into this emerging paradigm comes Paul, who finally seems to have found a home for his otherwise heterodox views. Whereas Russia is one of the few areas where the vast majority of the G.O.P. breaks with Trump, condemning his slavish devotion to Putin, Paul is‚Äîfor once‚Äîtruly aligned with the president, occupying the space where the screwball right and the White House converge: in Moscow.""*

*""Sen. Rand Paul (R., Ky.) has named as one of his key foreign policy advisers a controversial Russia policy expert with deep ties to the Kremlin.*

"NATO and the west have rushed in tens of thousands of anti-tank missiles and AA missiles since the war started. Without them, whatever stock they may have had before the war would have been all used up before now. And those are just the media-darling weapons. They've received tons and tons of many other kinds of military equipment and ammunition and supplies, as well. If Ukraine hadn't received this stuff, there's little doubt they'd have fared a lot worse than they have.",ttaszp
"I think there are 3 crucial elements that helped UA to turn the tide.

1. NLAWS and Javelins are the obvious.  Russian forces are heavily armored/tanks.  This plays right into the ATGM.

2. The Stingers - without them the Russian attack helicopters would have a field day against Ukrainian ground troops.

3. This one is vastly underrated - NATO intel.  With NATO intel, the Ukrainians know where the Russian tanks are heading and set up ambush.  Early warning system allows Ukrainian underpowered Air Force/defense a chance to knock planes/missiles out of the sky.

All three components are key.  Missing one and results would not be the same.",ttaszp
"Think the readily available anti-tank system makes the battlefield advantage towards the infantry.

The Russians didn't expect that many portable anti-tank weapons, and did not apply the appropriate strategy, and expected that their tanks would give them the protection.",ttaszp
And don't forget Starlink internet. That's a huge communication and command capability.,ttaszp
"Intel is probably more important than all the weapons combined. Remember that Russia wanted an internal coup to get rid of the Ukrainian government but the government managed to stop that. Also, they are finding traitors on a daily basis. People forget just how much data the five eyes collect constantly. That random meeting a Ukrainian official had with an FSB agent 5 year‚Äôs ago, can be connected to actions today through data mining.

It‚Äôs in rubles. It‚Äôs actually costing $2 a day.,t7t0zh
"the cost of war isnt just about wages and ammo, its fuel, at home jobs such as repairing vehicles, refitting broken items and equipment, building bombs artillery etc. on top of that, tanks, helicopters, planes, trucks and troops aren't cheap, 1 soldier for a year accrues a lot of costs training (ammo and the actual teachers), food, electricity, housing, equipment. even if they are conscripted it cost a lot to train, feed and house them while they are being made combat-ready. on top of that, Russian spetnaz cost millions to train and seconds to kill. russian special forces have experienced a massive hit in this war (the VDV is considered paratroopers and therefore SF). 

lookup the current losses of tanks planes and other equipment and see for yourself how much those cost (may not be 1 billion but they have to replace the losses). plus they have to pay the families of the deceased Etc... there is a heap of hidden costs to war most people don't see. such as fresh foods to soldiers, buying fuel, trade sanctions etc. using, equipment. even if they are conscripted it cost a lot to train, feed and house them while they are being made combat-ready. on top of that, Russian Spetsnaz cost millions to train and seconds to kill. Russian special forces have experienced a massive hit in this war (the VDV is considered paratroopers and therefore SF).  

the sanctions alone cause more economic damage than any war can Russia went from being a key trade partner to being completely shut off from the whole world in a night. those sanctions alone stop Russia from being able to tax its citizens on general goods. which makes up a lot of GDP as well as immigration/tourism.",t7t0zh
"An idling tank will use 1000 liters of fuel/day.  This is the reason why the convoy has stalled, the idling tanks have been burning through the fuel.  It is estimated that Russia is burning through 100-230 million liters of fuel/day.  Depending on the fuel (tank, plane, helicopter) this is probably close to 500 million/day.

The cost of transporting the military equipment from the far east to Ukraine was massive.  The transportation of military equipment has completely bogged down the rail transport system in Russia.

Each artillery shell, missile, and bomb has a cost associated with it.  When the US attacked that airfield in Syria, we spent 93 million USD to put some holes into an airfield.  A 500 lb bomb is thought to cost 1-5 million each (dumb versus smart).  All the artillery shells and missile launches each day is costing about 800 million/day for the Russians.  Of course, this is expecting that there is a 100% success rate for the Russian's ammo.  This has not been the case.  Examining the artillery positions captured by Ukraine, it is estimated that the successful firing of Russian shells is at 60-75%.

War is expensive.  The cost of the Iraq war is thought to be between 2-2.5 trillion for the US.  The initial invasion is thought to have cost 185 billion (first 15 days of the war).  Therefore, the US spent about 12.3 billion/day at the start of the war (and we faced way fewer losses than Russia has faced).",t7t0zh

I doubt this war costs 20 billion a day",t7t0zh

"Tricky question. The short answer is probably not. NATO could potentially host them as a government in exile. But unfortunately, the act of actively supporting their military operations from your bases in an active conflict is difficult, even among friendly countries. It‚Äôs an interesting thought, and certainly, this week, we‚Äôve seen countries do previously implausible things; from Hungary supporting Ukraine‚Äôs entrance into the EU, to the success of the Ukrainian armed forces, even to the fact that Russia invaded in the first place- so who knows.

NATO is responsible for protecting nations that belong to NATO. Ukraine is not part of NATO. The United Nations is the group that should be taking action.,vo57ue
"Do you want real answers, or are you just frustrated and want to vent? It's OK if you are just frustrated and need to let it out somewhere. If you want real answers, the truth is that there isn't one single thing that has determined what the West has and has not been willing to do, and the motivations aren't even the same between different countries. This list is not exhaustive or in any particular order, but here are some reasons why the West has not done more to actively force an end to this invasion:

* There is a risk of Nuclear war. How big of a risk? No one knows, but leaders tend to err on the side of caution when nukes are involved. The West wants Russia to lose, but they don't want them to ever feel like they are losing so badly that their leadership gets desperate enough to think that they have to launch nukes to avoid losing everything.
* Most Western nations feel bad for Ukraine, but not bad enough that they want to see their own people dying to protect them. As long as Ukraine can continue the fight with their own people, it is a hard sell to many of these nations to send their own people over to die for another country. Would the war end more quickly if NATO stepped in with its full force? Probably. Would less people end up dying? Who knows. Maybe they would crumble and back out, maybe it would galvanize the Russian people, maybe it would convince China that they needed to support Russia directly or risk loosing the best ally they have in opposing the dominance of the West. All we know for sure is that if NATO sends troops into Ukraine to fight, the war gets much larger.
* Germany in particular, but some other European nations as well don't want Russia to cut off their oil and gas. They have to balance protecting their economy and keeping their people from freezing in the winter with the moral need to deter Russia from it's current course. The German government is, first and foremost, responsible for protecting the German people, just like the government of any country would be. As much as they may dislike it, these countries must put the needs of their own people ahead of the needs of Ukraine.
* America has spent the last 50 years being vilified by the rest of the world for 'meddling' in the affairs of other countries. Every time we try to support democracy, or help one side or another in a civil war, or try to stop a genocide, we have been called invaders, murderers, imperialists, colonizers, and more. I've spent most of my adult life hearing from the rest of the west and the world in general that we are warmongers, and that the world would be better off if we didn't keep using our military in an attempt to protect western-style democracy and personal freedoms. I've heard all my life how us sending in troops to fight dictators and stop civil wars just ends up getting more innocent people killed. Well, that has had an effect. The world complained loudly enough about the vulgar, violent US involving its self in foreign wars that we finally started to listen. We aren't leaving our country to support freedom and democracy anymore. Simply being the right thing to do isn't good enough to motivate the American people anymore. We feel like to world hates us every time we send troops outside of our own borders to fight, so we are doing our best not to make this our war. We actually care about what the rest of the world wants, and we honestly thought the world didn't like us getting involved in other people's wars.
* NATO didn't want Russia to capture advanced weapons systems and be able to learn their secrets and possibly copy them. When it looked like Ukraine might get overrun, this was a huge risk and NATO wasn't willing to risk compromising it's own defense by sending in advanced systems when it wasn't clear they could be kept out of Russian hands. As the war has become more of a slow grind, NATO has increased the complexity of weapons it is willing to hand over. Also, it has become clear that the war will likely drag on long enough that NATO has time to train Ukrainian soldiers on more advanced systems. If it takes 10-12 weeks to get qualified on an air defense missile system, it wouldn't be worth the effort if the war was going to end in only 8 weeks. Since Russia doesn't seem like it is close to giving up, and Ukraine has been able to slow their advance sufficiently, it is worth teaching Ukraine how to use the more complicated weapons, and trying to figure out the logistics of keeping them working. Remember that it takes far more parts and maintenance technicians than operators to keep an advanced weapon system working.
* From a heartless, political perspective, you have to ask the question, ""What's in it for us?"" For Europe, they get to keep Russia further away from their doorstep. For the US, we get a weakened Russia through all the destroyed equipment and trained personnel, but that is about it. However, if we are getting those things with the level of support being given now, what would we get from providing more? Would sending F-35's or a bunch of NATO troops get us anything more? Probably not. In fact, it would probably cost us more money to get the same thing, just faster. There would need to be some perceived benefit to the west to give away billions more dollars of weapons or to send in their own troops, and apparently the politicians aren't seeing that benefit.
* The US still has to worry about China. Russia may be Ukraine's biggest threat, but China is a bigger threat to the US. America isn't going to give away so much stuff that it gives China an opening to exploit the temporary lack of equipment. We don't like what Russia is doing, but China is a much bigger threat in every way except maybe how many nukes they have.

There is other stuff as well, but this gives you an idea of the wide range of things that enter into the decision about how much to help Ukraine and how much to fight Russia.",vo57ue
They are afraid of nuclear war. It's that simple.,vo57ue

"Ukraine look we in the west are doing our absolute best to support you. But lets not petty point score for sympathy. We understand how barbaric Russia is. We don‚Äôt need our own atrocities used against us. There‚Äôs no need, not to mention both events are completely different. 

Rhetoric like this pushes people away from the cause not towards it. It‚Äôs cheap and I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs responsible at all. 

This is the second post this week I‚Äôve seen using 9/11 as a weapon. 

Death and sadism isn‚Äôt a competition. We are on your side and doing the best we can. Stop trying to guilt trip us, you‚Äôll do more harm than good.

"Let's suppose the US officially labels Russia as a terrorist state, then what? The US sanctions for [State Sponsors of Terrorism](https://www.state.gov/state-sponsors-of-terrorism/) are equal or lesser than the sanctions placed on Russia right now, save for those giving exemptions like Germany.

These are the punishments listed on that State Department website:

>Taken together, the four main categories of sanctions resulting from designation under these authorities include restrictions on U.S. foreign assistance; a ban on defense exports and sales; certain controls over exports of dual use items; and miscellaneous financial and other restrictions.

The only thing I'm surprised is why Wagner Group isn't listed on the [Foreign Terrorist Organizations](https://www.state.gov/foreign-terrorist-organizations/)? They just added FARC, so Wagner isn't that far of a stretch!",vo57ue

"What‚Äôs everyone that keeps posting things like this looking for from NATO and the USA?  This is not a game where people respawn and the countries that these people are wanting to intervene have the highest amount of nuclear arms and so does Russia.Guess what if NATO gets involved it becomes who strikes who first even though people keep saying that it won‚Äôt be the case.Honestly without all the training and weapon that UA has received they wouldn‚Äôt have done as good repelling the aggressor and will to fight can only get you so far without those things.

I feel bad for Ukraine and support them defending themselves and also I support my country the USA and NATO supplying  UA with weapons,training,and other supplies to continue defending themselves.But for those that don‚Äôt know we have a lot of issues at home that haven‚Äôt been addressed.Like homelessness for one which is becoming a really BIG problem here.",vo57ue

"This won‚Äôt get any upvotes but Ukraine is outgunned and ceding land throughout the Donbas region. Some like zelensky and credible WSJ reporters say by as much as 20:1 in heavy weapons in Donbas. Short-term, Ukraine is in for pain. Russia has massive stocks of conventional artillery and is relentlessly pounding Ukraine in much of the east.  Ukraine can only fire back sparingly - for now. Long term; more and larger systems are moving into Ukraine, this will start to even the playing field. some systems will have greater accuracy and reach than Russian systems which will make all the difference. but in the short term, Ukraine needs to buckle down and continue to strategically retreat when necessary so they can counter-offense if/when better aerial and arterially units arrive.

Some bleak but fair reporting: https://www.wsj.com/articles/russia-gains-ground-in-bid-to-encircle-troops-defending-ukraines-east-11653643841

Russian doctrine has always been that the arty is the main force everything else is used to get the arty in position... Best plan is to dig deep and have longer ranged arty .... Also a lot of western arty systems have amazing counter arty tech.. in Iraq war part 1 us arty would have a counter round at Iraqi position in the air before the Iraqi round even hit the ground...,v33n8o
"Russia has a finite amount of everything. Sometimes it‚Äôs better to concede territory whilst causing high causalities to the supply chain in order to counter attack an exhausted enemy.

Ukraine have shown this in other regions and I‚Äôm sure will begin in the coming weeks and months to counter the weakened Russia offensive.",v33n8o
Long range rockets the United States is sending that can be effective and accurate 37 miles further than Russia's artillery can reach.,v33n8o
They will use the weapons they are being sent and pummel russia back until russia finally runs out of gear or the regime at home changes and they give back the land.  I do not see Ukraine ever accepting Russia's idea of a truce and they shouldnt. all that would do is embolden russia to keep pushing through europe.  that is already their plan.,v33n8o
"There are a variety of ways to counter artillery fire, depending on how accurate and how mobile it is. The most common is to find a way to attack the artillery position from outside its effective range. You can do this with your own artillery if it has a technological advantage that lets it out-range the enemy. NATO has both rocket and tube artillery that will out-range much of what Russia is fielding, and Ukraine has been asking for that stuff. The NATO MLRS systems in particular can greatly out-range pretty much anything Russia has short of cruise missiles.

If you don't have better artillery, air to ground missiles and bombs delivered from aircraft are a very common way to attack artillery. Drones are basically the same as manned aircraft in that regard. Cruise missiles would also work, but are usually more expensive than you would want for hitting a bunch of towed artillery tubes. Ukraine has a limited ability to make these sorts of attacks, but probably don't have enough control of their airspace, or enough munitions to make this their primary means of destroying Russian artillery.

If you can't out-range artillery, there are other ways to deal with it as well. You can blind it. Artillery needs forward observation to tell it where to aim and if it is hitting where it is supposed to. If you can attack or negate its forward observation capability, you can make it much less effective. Keeping your forces highly mobile can help with this. Using camouflage and obscurants to hide movement and positions can help. If you can shoot down their spotting drones and use your scouts to keep their spotters away from your assets, that can help. Russia has satellite and air surveillance assets that would be difficult for Ukraine to counter, but they don't seem to have the best communications, so if you move before they can get information to the artillery batteries, you might still be able to keep them from hitting anything important.

Another option is to beat them in an artillery duel. So, an artillery duel is exactly what it sounds like. One side's artillery fires off a salvo, and then tries to pack up and move before the other side can pinpoint where they were, and fire back at that location. If you can pack up and move faster than the other guy, or you can pinpoint where they attacked from faster, you can eventually destroy more of their assets than they can of yours, even if you can't out-range them. This is where stuff like couter-battery radar and tracked systems like the M109 come into play. The NATO counter-battery radar is meant to pinpoint where Russian artillery is firing from quickly enough that the Ukrainians can fire back with their own artillery before the Russians can move. The M109 is meant to be able to fire and then move quickly so that they can leave before the equivalent Russian counter-battery systems can pinpoint them. Those two things are meant to win artillery duels, and in the case of the radar also to minimize the need for forward observers to find the enemy artillery in the first place.

You can also just attack them directly. This is probably the most difficult for Ukraine (or any army) to pull off, but if you can force a break in the enemy lines, or temporarily bypass them with an airborne assault, artillery isn't good at protecting its self up close from ground troops. Ukraine would need to force a gap in the Russian lines or be able to covertly get troops behind their lines to accomplish this, but hasn't shown much ability to do either of those things. I mean, if Ukraine could readily break the Russian lines, they could attack all kinds of stuff in the rear areas, not just the arty! It's possible, but not terribly likely. Luckily, the Russians don't seem to be able to do much of that either!",v33n8o
"it won't. I think by the time Nato gives enough metal to counter, Ukraine will run out of trained troops",v33n8o

"I don't understand international condemnation of Ukraine attacking Russia in response to Russia invading them. Ukraine didn't start this, Russia did. I think strikes on Russian soil that harm Russia's ability to continue the invasion are totally legit and valid. If I'm missing the big reason here, let minnow üêü",viycli
"They won't use nuclear weapons on Ukraine or Ukrainian forces unless they start invading Russia and the entire Russian military has begun to collapse. Ukraine will not do this and has no desire to invade or occupy any part of Russia. They have never had such a desire and will never develop one.

These attacks on Russian soil have been carefully targeted at military/industrial sites designed to make  waging the war even more challenging than it already is for Russia. They will not incur any retaliation that Russia isn't already doing. Ask Mariupol or Bucha what could have been worse for them.

Ukraine could be blowing up every oil refinery within a hundred kilometres of the border and it would not trigger a nuclear attack. It's simply not going to happen. You don't need to worry about it.",viycli

"Hmm i think that is the problem why Ukraine don't get really heavy weapons with long range ( cruise missiles for example) 

They scared that Ukraine attack Russia directly. 

But the Russian had a problem what is good for us.
The can't accept that Ukraine has the capability to strike on russian territory and that their AA can't intercept them. 

So this is our luck, Russia will never say that a attack from Ukraine on their territory was successful. 
So there is no reason for nukes.",viycli
"Is it retaliation or preemptive strikes?

Ukraine has a ton of reasons for retaliation. But I see them as preemptive strikes. Ukraine attacking these ammo/fuel depots on russian soil stops the orcs from using weapons and equipment against them. If they can't attack you, you have no reason for retaliation.",viycli
"Russia fell into the same trap the US did post WWII, why would we need a large well trained and equipped conventional army when we have nukes?

The Russians leadership is the one behaving extreme.

Starting this  whole war and being responsible for the consequences vs bombs on some fuel or arms depot in Russia.

It needs to get more extreme. It's fine if you call it liberating Russians or DeNazifying Russia.",viycli
"Industrial sites are legitimate military targets as per Protocol I to the Geneva Conventions, Article 52.   


There isn't really any precedent for Russia to say otherwise and retaliate over that in any way that claimed Ukraine's actions somehow inflamed tensions beyond what they already were. Certainly not with nukes.",viycli
"The Ukrainian army conducted some strikes against Russian refineries and logistical centers in belgogrod and the Russian shrugged it off.

Now if nato is driving in Moscow they will go berserk but absent that no",viycli
">Russia have said that they would only use Nukes to protect their sovereignty.

This already isn't exactly true, russian doctrine allows for use of ""low"" power nukes on a tactical level in regular war scenarios.

Anyways if the russians said anything about striking on russian soil, I'd argue oil refineries, munitions depots, tank factories and so on are perfectly viable military targets, as they all provide the russians with more arms or fuel to run their arms.",viycli

"I mean its absolutely ok for me to strike ruSSian soil, even if there will be a nuclear war in the aftermath, it was still the right thing to do. Sorry, not sorry, even if we all die, it is still better than giving the ruSSians the power to threaten us nonstop with the nuke card.",viycli
"I think Poopler is not so idiotic to not know that the use of nukes means the complete and utter end of Russia as we know it. No more Moscow, no more St Petersburg, no more Irkutsk, Vladivostok, Sochi, Russian culture, oligarchs, gas lines, navy‚Ä¶. they would be 100% annihilated, irradiated and extinct as an entity.

Russia had invaded, without pretext, a sovereign nation with whom it had a treaty to not do so. Russia involved Belorussia and Chechnya. 

They have have stolen ~500,000,000 tons of Ukrainian grain. They have destroyed Ukrainian infrastructure. 

To pretend that Russian territory is inviolate is silly.",viycli
"Ukraine can not be too scared to retaliate, while counterattacks are essential in driving invaders out of territory. You have to weaken forces beyond the border to completely remove them.",viycli
"I say Ukraine should haul up the Black Flag.  No Quater, no mercy",viycli
"Unless you have nato armies rolling towards Moscow it‚Äôs highly unlikely to see any Russian nuke getting tossed.  

And since there is almost no senario that NATO invades Russia, it‚Äôs not going to happen.  

A little Ukrainian cross border shelling or drone strikes or even air strikes against strategic military targets like ammo dumps or logistical targets to hinder Russian attacks on Ukraine will not get a nuclear response from Russia.   

Nukes are a very real red line that only the most unhinged rogue state would use as they all know the response would be devastating and make the attacker a complete pariah globally.",viycli
"Russia believes that the EU and NATO are weak and never more than a crisis away from turning on each other to save their own skins. 

I'm just some guy on the internet but, in terms of escalation, I think the most likely scenario is using a low yield nuke somewhere in Ukraine as a ""demonstration"", in the hopes that it will create panic and fracture what they believe to be an already tenuous NATO alliance. 

Using a nuke against a NATO country WILL result in a measured response. The US or UK would select a comparable Russian target and nuke it. This limited exchange would continue until one side backs down.

I don't know how much, if any, real influence Beijing has over Moscow, but I'm sure they don't want to see their two most important export markets (N. America and Europa) destroyed, with the potential of China being drawn into a nuclear war.

Everyone needs to calm down. We've been much closer to the brink, many times in the past, albeit with a more sane Soviet regime. Still, Putin can't launch a missile. He has to order someone to do it, and there are many people involved in that chain who can say ""nyet"".",viycli
"Russia has, historically, suffered from random fires and explosions at critical infrastructure, for decades. I think 95% of what we're seeing now is the result of incompetence and corruption, not sabotage.",viycli
"Since the pinnacle of Ukraine long-term strategy still is a popular revolt/coup in russia It would be highly counterproductive to directly attack russtard civilians.

And even after they drop that shit in near future, there won't be any sort of nuclear retalation, deal with that. I doubt they would not even start to strategically bomb Ukrainian population after that. Those things move strictly according to concept of equvialency. At least until some extreme margin is crossed. And even deaths of several hundreds of civilians is not that margin in russtardia.

The thing is that after those potential attacks russtard goverment would have several aces in their sleeves, which could help them mobilize both population and economy because It would be much easier for their propaganda machine to turn this quagmire into defensive war, which coincidentally is the only possible war russtardia could wage.",viycli
"There's another video of this group being questioned with translation.

The only rational outcome for Russia is to immediately stop the war, withdraw, overthrow the regime, hold democratic elections, fully cooperate with war crimes tribunals, pay reparations and so on.

Beyond the first few seconds of the video in Ukrainian which I don‚Äôt understand the whole video is in Russian.

She is from Crimea but they left after Russia annexed it as they did not want to live in Russia.

Later they tried to return to Crimea for their summer holidays (‚Äòsummer break‚Äô for Americans) and were turned away because of their Ukrainian citizenship.

Later they managed to get into Crimea and she talks about how wonderful the [Tatars](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tatars) are, many of them are friends and how they always loved Crimea and refused to leave, Russia has since persecuted them and imprisoned many of them.

She points out that the referendum was fake, people who speak out against russia are sent to prison and the others stay silent out of fear. [added by /u/akstis01]

She didn‚Äôt specify how but on a later attempt it took them 30 mins to pass the Ukrainian border and ‚Äú7 bloody hours!‚Äù to get through the Russian side of the border. This seems to be her biggest issue with Russia. üôÑ

She complains about tedious paperwork and how it took so long to fill out four lines.

She then briefly remarks on that in Crimea they have removed any evidence of its Ukrainian past and put Russian flags everywhere like at the train station.

Overall I‚Äôm not sure why this has 150 upvotes, maybe people see young woman speaking in foreign language and assume she is complaining about Russia and upvote. Most of the dialogue is pretty inane teenager complaining.

"Nukes, bro.  We can't just swing in and save the day without the fear of a nuclear exchange.

They're basically the only thing which has stopped a massive global war from occurring again.",tgzs5t
I think it has to do with logistics and pre planning on both sides. The leaders are establishing sides and allies and with both side being surprised who answers the phone.

"It is a philosophical question: should nuclear obliteration be avoided at all costs? Or is there some red line so atrocious that can be crossed where we should risk it? 

If WWIII goes nuclear, the world as we know it would cease to exist due to fall out and climate impacts; most of us would probably die or end up wishing we had. Even if every russian nuke ends up being a dud from lack of maintenance, a NATO preemptive strike in russia would cause catastrophic outcomes in the northern hemisphere. 

Nuclear capable countries have absolutely bullied other countries without fear of an equal consequences since 1945. Is it morally right? No. Has it happened a lot? Yes.",tgzs5t

Years of fear mongering from Russians openly talking about rebuilding the Soviet Union. Soldiers flying the flag. What more do we need to show it doesn‚Äôt stop here. Georgia, Moldova, Baltic states the list goes on and on. Blatant lies from Russian state tv. We all know what putin wants. We need to be more aggressive in holding on to out freedoms and others. We used to stand by democratic countries. I don‚Äôt think I could look a Ukrainian in the eyes anymore and say me buying medical supplies to send over was me doing my bit.",tgzs5t
"The whole thing about the ""we will get drug into it"" argument is that if you go to war without the enemy attacking first, your populace may not support the war and outsiders will spend the whole war calling you an aggressor.  The political side of war is often dominant. America before Pearl Harbor didn't want anything to do with European or Asian wars. Once America was attacked, the people were generally united. Another American example is from the American Civil War: the Union waited until they had been attacked to declare an emergency and raise volunteer troops. There was no doubt in anybody's mind: the Confederacy fired the first shots of the war and it helped solidify a shaky northern/ Union public opinion and helped lead to ultimate victory.",tgzs5t
I absolutely agree. This had been my stance from the beginning. War is hell and we dont want it. But evil exists and in WWII we ignored the evil until it came to us at pearl harbor.,tgzs5t

"Yes, people, pray for war, we need war, war is peace.",tgzs5t
Edit: Let me be clear I‚Äôm not a war hawk. I realize that nuclear weapons makes this complicated. Shitty precedent to let dictators with nukes just take anything they want. I think tons of drones and anti aircraft is what we need to do and we are. Maybe more? It‚Äôs the 21st century and we haven‚Äôt figured out how to stop kleptocrats. Why is Putin so hot for the Russian empire being restored? He‚Äôs obsessed. The loss of wheat crops will be a humanitarian disaster world wide.,tgzs5t
"I understand that emotions are high. Few of us can watch the Russian military's continuing assault on Ukraine and its people with ever increasing brutality and savagery. It goes against everything we hold to be correct and just, and we all feel like we, our governments, and our people should do something.

So we try and justify the need for action by turning to history: ""we've seen this before"", ""this is just like the prelude to WW2"", and ""war is inevitable."" We convince ourselves that yes, we should intervene now because we think it's only going to get worse, that a greater war is unavoidable, and it would be doing the right thing.

However, this is where we make a mistake. Although it may not seem like it, Putin is losing this war by the day. Because Putin sold this war to the Russian people as a quick ""special operation"" to remove ""Nazis"" in Ukraine, the Russian people's appetite and tolerance for a protracted conflict was low. This is only going to be made worse by the crippling sanctions imposed on the Russian economy, increasing casualty numbers, and a lack of a clear end in sight. This may eventually lead to greater unrest among the Russian people, but more importantly, among Russia's political and economic elites who could organize and push for his removal.

So what Putin and his propaganda machine have begun doing is framing this as the West's war against Russia. This is why we've seen some of the patently ludicrous news and statements coming from Russian officials lately - bio labs, NATO expansion, Russophobia, economic warfare. We laugh at these statements, but we must understand that these messages were also directed at the Russian audience, to give credibility to their claims that this is a war of the West vs. Russia and the survival of the Russian state is what is at stake.

Once we understand how Putin is now framing this war in the minds of the Russian people, we can now appreciate why any preemptive military intervention by NATO or the EU member states at this point in time is a grave mistake. This is because for the everyday Russian, it gives irrefutable, concrete credibility to Putin's claims. It galvanizes Russians against a clear, external threat from Russia's history, and allows them to rally under Putin against all enemies. This provides him with the justification to call up Russia's reserves, to instruct the Russian people to endure sanctions, and the support and resources he needs to ensure his own political survival.

Putin is essentially attempting to hide behind Russia by equating his survival with that of the Russian state and people. Knowing this, we will play Putin's game if NATO or EU countries intervene at this stage. I know it's tough, it's a terrible decision to make, but the best thing NATO and EU countries and its citizens can do is to continue supporting Ukraine, including providing arms, while avoiding a direct confrontation with Russia.",tgzs5t
"Things are happening. A lot of it is going to me manovering, timing, and seeing what is most effective.  A lot of the airstrikes being done by Russia would also not be stopped by a no fly zone in the first place.  Russia is mostly not flying their planes over Ukraine in the first place. They are using ground launched equipment.  The fighters are firing from over Russian airspace.

It is not that we are doing nothing, but the nukes are something to watch for.  It is like defusing a bomb - you work as fast as you can without tripping the safety and having it detonate.",tgzs5t
"I‚Äôm assuming you‚Äôre American based on your comment. First thing to consider from the US perspective is‚Ä¶geographically, we are in a spot that we could be totally neutral. We have the two largest oceans on both sides of us, and no real military threat to the north or south. So the fact we get involved at all is a moral choice, that many countries wouldn‚Äôt make. 

Second, If the US gets involved, it is likely more people would die overall because more countries would join. 

Third, is Europe entitled to American soldiers lives? As of now American soldiers are also ‚Äúinnocent‚Äù in all of this just like the Ukraine civilians.  So should European countries be the ones stepping up first considering they are closer to the threat and in more imminent danger? The European Union is finally realizing they need to be a stronger force for democracy and they can‚Äôt fully rely on the US, which it how it should be in my personal opinion.",tgzs5t

"On November 4, 1979, 52 American hostages were taken from the US Embassy in Tehran.

It was hard not to find a city block that didn‚Äôt have numerous yellow ribbons. Many of those ribbons stayed tied for 444 days until the Americans were finally released.

Even after this war is over, we are probably going to have to endure some hardships like higher  inflation and gas prices. I suggest we tie blue and yellow ribbons once again to show our support for Ukraine and as a way of remembering why we are enduring higher costs.",t8pcp6

"There has been an 'active' line of conflict with both sides using artillery to attack each other since 2014, over such a long time it's pretty impossible to not accidentally hit a civilian who was in the wrong place at the wrong time.


However, it's still important to note this was hugely exaggerated by the Russian side, who claimed Ukraine were actively bombing civilians. The big propaganda piece they used was a kindergarten which had been hit, although all the video/pictures were directly and unashamedly taken straight from the Ukrainians after they posted articles about the traitors hitting a kindergarten on their side.


So basically, yes there's been a war zone there and accidents happen, but we should remember how willing the Russians are to straight up lie and exaggerate to suit their purposes.",v3vuzb
"In 2014 Russia started sending Wagner and VDV in to back and arm separatists in Donbass as soon as Maidan ended. In that process, separatists (with the help of Russia) started taking cities in Donbass, including Maripoul at one point. In the process, Ukraine started to fight and take back these cities.

Separatists started firing at Ukrainians, Ukrainians fired back. It sucks, but Ukraine had a small, untrained and weak military at that point, and civilians just got caught in the artillery cross fire between both sides.

So the ""bombs"" means artillery.

On the Russian side, they claim the separatists built their own autonomous break-off regions and that territory was now separate from Ukraine. In Ukraine eyes, that territory was still Ukranian land. 

Basically it was a civil war, and civilians just got caught in the middle of it. Russia claims the separatists side were not firing at Ukraine, and Ukraine was just aimlessly ""bombing"" civilians in a genocde - which is absurd. Russia started and backed the entire thing.

If you want a good documentary on the start of the 2014 conflict, check out Vice's ""Russian Roulette"" documentary series on youtube.",v3vuzb
"To tell you the truth: Ukrainian army *did* use artillery on the residential areas in Donbass, BUT it wasn't done to deliberately harm civilians or damage the infrastructure. Whenever your position is hit with artillery, it's in a military doctrine to calculate from where it came from and strike back. In other words - russians deliberately placed their artillery in the residential areas (multiple video proof) made a shot and quickly ran away, shots made by Ukrainian artillery landed in the area and there was a bunch of russian reporters nearby waiting to show ""See?SEE? They are deliberately bombing people here!""",v3vuzb
"That‚Äôs a common strategy by the Russians. Proclaiming that a Russian minority is endangered and harassed by other ethnicities. By that, they are constructing a pseudo reason to intervene. See South Ossetia and Donbass. A cheap FSB game in the end",v3vuzb
"Countries bomb and kill their own people all the time. That's not the question. The question is, did Ukraine actually bomb is own civilian population in those regions? Because a building being used as a base by russian-sponsored terrorists (they're terrorists, not separatists, because it's not an authentic, popular independence movement) who are bombing and shooting the normal civilian population and public officials, is a pretty good reason to bomb that building. There's a difference between bombing the civilian population, and bombing killers hiding behind a facade of populist insurgency",v3vuzb
"That's what happens when the state controls the media, criticism and questions = straight to gulag",v3vuzb
But are many of the Russian in Donbass because they were moved there by USSR? And are now Ukrainian but want to be in Russia?,v3vuzb
"They did.  There has been a war going on there for years and even when unintentional civilian casualties happen.  

What is more odd to me is people who support Russia and blame the USA solely because no USA support would mean a quick defeat and less suffering.  However, these same people who base their allegiance on a quick conflict resolution never blame Russia for extending the conflict in the east.  Without Russian support the Eastern uprisings would have been swiftly put down.",v3vuzb
"It's because they've been taught for years that the west is always actively trying to hurt and defame Russia, so they would never believe their own government would lie to them. It's crazy",v3vuzb
"Propaganda and the believers in it do not care for logic.

It takes 2 minutes to look at the results of Russian actions in 100 days on any city vs. alleged Ukrainian bombardment of Donetsk or other Donbas cities over last 8 years. It's incomparable.",v3vuzb
"It has happened, but only started after ruzzian separatists started doing shit in there and got support from ruzzia. And the ammount of casualties was falling. Last couple of years there were like 10-30 people dying there due to conflict. 
Ruzzia started that shit in donbas 8years ago to nott let ukraine cut their ties with corrupt ruzzia and develop normally like a normal country. It still had their corruption problem but chose the right way. Ruzzia couldn‚Äôtjust loose there sphere of interest.",v3vuzb
"The short answer isn't Russian propaganda, the short answer is that there's been a civil war in the Donbass for almost a decade supported by Russia",v3vuzb
"Same reason Russian supporters ask ‚Äúwhy doesn‚Äôt Ukraine go back to Normandy format, Minsk 1 or 2?‚Äù

The separatists violated the ceasefire each time.

So the reason Ukraine was in a war with Donbas is because Donbas is Ukraine, and Ukraine wants it back from the separatists.",v3vuzb
Because they are brainwashed with this ‚Äúfact‚Äù.,v3vuzb
"Russians basically know Putin did the apartment bombings and they go along with having him in power, either due to fear, or masochism to his tyranny. So when there's border violence, there's no reason to be confident it was not Putin machinations to objective people. Professionals have their takes about things, but these boards are open to public, and this is insanity. Nobody could border Putin unless they're a puppet. Silly premise.",v3vuzb
"Direct answer to the question in the title is simple. 

Because for 8 years it was talked about on the news, daily and for several hours, on all channels, on all info shows.",v3vuzb
[removed],v3vuzb
">I know that the short answer is russian propaganda.

Dude, have you ever heard of western propaganda?

Why is Iraq and the Middle East so fucked up?

Did Iraq harbor weapons of mass destruction as claimed by the US?

Better to sit on the fence and read both sides of the story. This war was long forthcoming.",v3vuzb
"My good friend is of Ukrainian and Russian decent. Part of her family lives in both countries. Her aunt lives in Ukraine, she has told me her Ukrainian aunt blames the war on Ukraine leadership. She also said the government has in fact targeted Russian churches, schools etc via attacks/bombing in the region for years. She lives an hour from the capital. Who knows where propaganda begins and ends. The only thing I know factually, is that I have heard first hand of a Ukrainian blaming the government and believing attacks have occurred. So confusing.",v3vuzb
"I don't think that. 
But what are you want from ppl, who participated in MMM like for, three times.",v3vuzb
"Sounds like there were also issues with corruption (or claimed issues) with the 2-3 previous presidential administrations before Zelenskyy, which can lead to lots of problems all across the government and armed forces. I‚Äôm far from knowledgeable on the subject and this should be expanded or refuted by someone that has a better source (like living there) than my picking through a variety of US media sources and trying to figure out which is most likely true.",v3vuzb

"Quality ""made in germany"", car burned down and rusted and the german license plate as good as new? No official sticker seals.

Orcs trying to set up a fake story. Stupidity at it's finest.",uklz01
"Not to defend the video, but is it unreasonable to think a German car may be in Ukraine?

It‚Äôs not that easy though who is gonna fly them? The Ukrainian pilots aren‚Äôt familiar with American jets much less the a-10 which has a very niche use and doesn‚Äôt fly like most military aircraft not to mention that Ukrainian air doctrine doesn‚Äôt include close air support missions like those the a-10 does. And Yes it was made with the specific purpose of destroying Russian tanks but due to advances in air defense systems it‚Äôs not clear how effective it could be during the modern battlefield,t62x16
"that would be cool, but they would need pilots who know  how to fly them  


something ukraine neither has nor has the time to train",t62x16
"Not only are the pilots not trained, the mechanics aren't either. You need manuals in Ukrainian, parts, equipment to service them with, etc. It would take months to make them serviceable without American support.",t62x16
Lol are both sides gonna fight with cold war era equipment,t62x16
Pilots aside you need air superiority to effectively use the A10,t62x16
Oh god I would love to see a few Warthogs in Ukraine üòç,t62x16
"The Su-25 is basically the same thing, except it carries a ton of bombs instead of a giant autocannon.  Ukraine also has pilots who can actually fly the Su-25 too.",t62x16

"I am not trying to say it's not Azov, but there wasn't a single word to identify these guys. There wasn't a single word in Ukrainian. No uniform, no documents, no names. Even his tattoos seem to be in russian. Kadyrovtsy known to be tik-tok fighters. They haven't been in the front line a single day through the whole war. All they do is post those videos. There were previously videos of dudes wearing russian uniforms but with blue bandages and tik-tok batalion made them shout Akhmat Sila. They know russians won't be able to tell the difference. It's mostly propaganda made to show power to russians. Not so much to Ukrainians. 
Maybe I'm wrong but this doesn't seem credible.",to5wdg
"Chechen fucks don't take prisoners, and they certainly don't feed them.",to5wdg

"Despite russian missile attacks, the Ukrainians are keeping their railways running, and i don't doubt there are a lot of trucks and lowboys hauling stuff 24/7 from Poland to the fronts. General expectations are that they will have enough supplies and weaponry to begin serious-sized counterattacks by mid-June or so. Right now, I'm pretty sure the primary effort is going to be to do what they can to counterattack eastward from the Kharkiv/Chuihiv area to try to cut off the russians at Izyum, or at least reduce the amount of supplies coming from russia into that area. That would do a lot to reduce the pressure from the north pincer of the russian's Donbass offensive.",uqpkkf
I would suggest doing your research. Most of the howitzers are already on the front lines and main counteroffensive is in the northeast regions - Kharkov offensive is more or less done so they are moving on the Izium. They decided to attack it straight from the west side through the woods. That battle is actually underway for couple of days now. Izium has the largest concentration of russian soldiers in Ukraine (20-25% of total force). It would be a major blow to rf military if UA offensive is successful. It‚Äôs unlikely russia could bounce back if they lose battle for Izium. None of other russian offensive efforts would matter,uqpkkf
If they can take the dam that would be huge.  Whoever controls the dam controls the south.,uqpkkf

It‚Äôs not often you can get the government to agree on things across parties, but as far as I know every major political party is in agreement to support Ukraine.",vte1ke

"From the Russian side it all comes down to how much are they willing to risk? There's a risk of poisoning someone else besides the president such as a facilitator from Turkey. I also think that Russia killing Zelensky while he's in Turkey or even him suddenly getting sick would cause even more issues with them internationally. It would be a very very dangerous game if they did that.

  
From the Ukrainians perspective nothing that I've seen leads me to believe that they would want to do anything like that honestly. But I could be wrong.

&#x200B;

Bad idea for both sides overall.",tv5aep
"The Russians can‚Äôt touch Zelensky in this meeting. The Ukrainians can touch Putin in this meeting.

Those are the political realities, domestically and abroad. But I doubt anybody will abuse Turkey‚Äôs trust.",tv5aep
"Also, Zelensky is ‚Äûonly‚Äú a servant of his people whereas Putin sees his people as his serf. 
Zelensky does not see himself as important, important is the will of the Ukrainian people to be free and to fight for this freedom.",tv5aep
"There isn't many chances that you can lure out Putin out of his bunker, this might be the one and only chance Zelenskyy can get close to him. This could result in an ultimate sacrifice to put a stop to Putin.

At the same time, Putin is seething of so much hate and anger towards Zelenskyy, he couldn't believe that a comedian whom he considers as too inferior to him has tarnished his reputation to the whole world, exposed Russia's military capability--whole world has lost respect to their military might and the tables totally turned as Russians is now being compared to NAZI and Putin as Hitler wannabe.

As we can see, these two build a perfect recipe for a brewing peace treaty disaster.",tv5aep
"Don't know why, it reminded me of Narnia: Prince Kaspian. You know, the scene, where big bad for most of the film is killed by one of his men, who then shouts that evil narnians killed their leader and the've all charged to battle. Imagine if some Putin's worm is now ploting to poison him in Turkey. Then he will take power and turn dead dictator into martyr, who was slaughtered by rotten west. He will anounce mass mobilistion. Russians, filled with hatred, after their Tsar was killed will flood Ukraine, soviet style. Suddenly, russian commanders will have as much cannon fodder, as they want to.",tv5aep

When exactly was it prohibited? Which convention do you mean here?,v5zsp6
"What a utterly horrifying and beautiful weapon at the same time. I keep trying to remember where I have seen this before and I believe it was Vietnam. The ""daisy cutter"" was the heaviest conventional non nuclear bomb we had that was used to create LZs for our. Choppers to evacuate wounded soldiers and those needing evac (and make literal mince meat out of any VCs in the area).  I keep seeing the cook off type explosion up near the tree line. Those rockets are landing well behind whatever vehicle (tank?) that is exploding. The pressure waves alone caused that. I wonder if any of the MLARS missiles we are sending with the launch vehicles are thermobaric? Probably not because for the most part ruzzians are usually fighting in civilian areas. Think I would give my left nut to see so daisy cutters dropped on these orcs. Think their moral is low now? Sheee-it, I wanna see these fuckers surrendering in droves like Sadam's army.",v5zsp6

The US isn't a signatory to any treaties regarding cluster or thermobaric weapons.  We used them in caves in Afghanistan to the cheers of people watching us going after Al Queda.  Now it sucks that they're being used against the country we've come to adore and are supporting.  But instead of wasting time whining what is in a treaty neither combatant is a signatory to perhaps we should push for getting them more advanced weapons faster and not just in a reactionary fashion and even leave it up to Kyiv whether to use it on Russian territory or not.  Fuck Russia and fuck all this illegal crap... it's illegal to destroy civilian infrastructure and rape civilians and a whole host of things that are being documented and investigated (but unlikely anyone of importance will ever be held accountable).  The naivete of those who post this stuff is amazing.  Call your Senator and demand more weapons for Ukraine.  (I'm just assuming this dumb crap us coming from my fellow Americans that are so indignant they call use of a weapons system illegal when the whole damn war is illegal).,v5zsp6

Did he try to join or did he just ask Clinton to see his reaction,xhgf5b
Cry me a River!,xhgf5b
Alright bill tell us what you said now.,xhgf5b
I knew it was all Bill Clinton's fault.,xhgf5b
Does Putin really need reminding why Eastern European former Warsaw Pact countries wanted to join NATO as soon as they got the chance? And why Russia has no place in the alliance that seeks protection against his very country‚Ä¶I thought he was a sort of history buff‚Ä¶,xhgf5b
"NATO was created for one reason - to protect Europe from the USSR.  That is all there is to know.  When the USSR imploded along with all of their slave-state satellite countries, those actually running the show, Communist Party honchos, took control of the governments and institutions, including banks and industries.  This created an infrastructure of oligarchs and kleptocrats.  Poland, the Czech Republic, and Slovakia were the first to embrace the West's style of society.  They efficiently created new states with no ties to the former communist elites.  Unfortunately, the other former Soviet ""republics"" were not so lucky; the communists kept their power and became extremely wealthy through corruption.  

Zelensky was the first Ukrainian president to begin the fight to unravel the bureaucracy, corruption, and dominance by oligarchs: ‚ÄúMy election proves that our citizens are tired of the experienced, pompous machine politicians who over the 28 years \[of independence\], have created a country of opportunities ‚Äì the opportunities to bribe, steal and pluck the resources,‚Äù Zelensky said in his inaugural address in May 2019.   
  
‚ÄúWe will build a country of other opportunities ‚Äì one where all are equal before the law and where all the rules are honest and transparent, the same for everyone,‚Äù he said. And then, to the utter shock of onlookers inside the Verkhovna Rada, and awe of the crowds outside and watching on television, Zelensky dismissed the parliament and announced new elections.",xhgf5b
"He should join, now, so he could lose in fighting himself!",xhgf5b
"Imagine the current war, except Russia is a NATO ally and Ukraine is not.

There is no prescribed process for removing a member from NATO.  It would have to be done country by country.  What a mess that would be.  If Russia had been allowed in NATO, it would have meant the death of NATO.",xhgf5b
My understanding is that Russia were invited to apply but Putin felt Russia shouldn't have to get in the queue like 'normal' countries?,xhgf5b
"They said you had to apply and wait like any other country, you toolface. Russia is a headache for anyone around it, and Clinton could have just said ""fuck off, we're full"", but no, he was too kind.",xhgf5b
yOu WonT seE tHis oN wEstErN meDiA,xhgf5b
Wow so this is all our fault.  I'm mortified.,xhgf5b
Probably had other things in mind...,xhgf5b
He wants to join NATO to veto any action and steal military secrets. I can't believe his plan didn't work.,xhgf5b
We already know this and this wasn‚Äôt the first time they tried to join NATO in the 1950s the Soviet Union tried joining too,xhgf5b
"He wanted to join Nato to make Friends with the guys who want to keep him in Check. 
Nato Russia would invade stuff hoping no one would intervene.",xhgf5b
"Yeah nah, putin bro you‚Äôre like the last kid left in line on sports day that no one wants. You and the rest of your pals like North Korea etc",xhgf5b
NATO is the pepper spray and you are the rapist. F..k off.,xhgf5b
That was a trolling question.,xhgf5b
Bruce Lee would like to kick Putin in the face over and over again,xhgf5b
"With friends like Russia, who needs enemies?",xhgf5b
"Cry me a River i'ma buy you a belt but the pain still the Same and this guap don't Help..
No respect",xhgf5b
Lies and manipulations,xhgf5b
Maybe we should had accepted your offer to defend your sorry ass against the ukros you lying cunt!,xhgf5b
"We can be sure that Pootins offer to join NATO had nothing to do with gaining access to advanced weapons systems, communications, military strategy, et all.

Nah, he wouldn't have been hoping ""it's enemy"" would hand over their playbook, intelligence, and best weapons so that Ruzzia would know exactly what they faced in a conflict and had ample time to copy it, counter it, overcome it, render it less useful. 

Good gracious, this guy's has become such a hopeless and laughable liar. Can you imagine how he would crow and gloat and admire himself in the mirror if Clinton had been fool enough to fall for such a ploy. Go to hell, Putin.",xhgf5b
honestly impressive if Bill Clinton managed to respond restrained. I would have bursted out laughing,xhgf5b
"you can never be part of a good organisation like NATO. and in Ukraine we see why. we dind't make you bad, putler. you ARE the baddies. fuck ruzzia, get rekt",xhgf5b
because you never ever can trust a f\*\*\*g lying russian!,xhgf5b
Anybody know when this recording was made?,xhgf5b
"It is Putin's chess move. The question is if you can trust the things he said. Nothing to see here.

One fact I think helps: if Putin really wanted to join NATO, what he really wanted to tell the world is NATO had no reason to exist. Got it?",xhgf5b
—Ö—É–π–ª–æ –ï–ë–ê–ù–û–ï![gif](emote|free_emotes_pack|poop),xhgf5b
So he hates NATO because he‚Äôs jelly??? Sure seems like it,xhgf5b
The very existence of NATO was being anti Soviet front.,xhgf5b
Because it's like Dr Evil joining the UN.,xhgf5b
Like the fox joining the chicken run,xhgf5b
"NATO offered Russia, not the other way around. It was Russia that wasn't looking to be friends.üòÖ

Just as well Russia isn't in, or they would have done what they did to the UN... Abusing a Veto in order to invaid a country. Russia isn't even using an official membership to the UN, they are using the Soviet Unions and were not voted in. Tbh Ukraine or Kazakhstan has more right to that Soviet UN position than Russia.",xhgf5b
There are plenty of kingdoms in NATO. And you can't talk bad about the monarchs.  But you also don't get thrown out of a window.,xhgf5b
Can you imagine how many wars we would be in if Russia did ..,xhgf5b
NOBODY PUTS BABY IN THE CORNER! Order the InVaSiOn,xhgf5b
NATO was formed because Russia is a terrorist state that meddls in its neighbors business. Look at Russias recent history with its neighbors and u will see why all the smaller countries want protection against That Maggot Putin!!!,xhgf5b
Talk is cheap. Does he have proof he asked to join nato?,xhgf5b
"Thanks to the Nato, there are probably no big skirmishes and wars between Turkey (not big fan, but atleast it keeps them somehow at bay) and Greece.",xhgf5b
What if hitler tried to join the western Allies?,xhgf5b

He mad. First rule of fight club: don‚Äôt talk about fight club.,xhgf5b
"How would it even work when they invade some other country (like ukraine) and nato and other ukraine-friendly countries,  still support ukraine?",xhgf5b
"Russia could have joined NATO, but they didn't want to go through the application process and their responses was something along the lines of ""great nations don't join alliances, they create them.""",xhgf5b
This is common knowledge to anyone who reads,xhgf5b
"Neither Putin nor Russia can be trusted; we have seen this with every treaty, agreement, and war.",xhgf5b
"He said it himself!! Democracy. It's funny how most NATO countries change leader, and then Russia,doesn't, because it's a clear dictator ship, and now has a surprised Pikachu face.",xhgf5b
"Our officials and military swore to defend freedom and democracy around the world.  For the many faults we can bring against America, numerous and including unprovoked warfare, Russia was murdering babies in Chechnya, babies in Syria, and babies in Ukraine the entire time Putin has been in power, with the intent to do so.  That's why the west doesn't want Russia as friend or ally.",xhgf5b
Well  Russia is the enemy aggressor why would they want to join nato,xhgf5b
Cry me a river Putan!,xhgf5b
Clinton was smart. They would just be a decisive cancer like they are in the U.N.,xhgf5b
"Ruzzia and Nato
Are like pig and bird. Russism, which is a form of attack vs NATO, which is a defense alliance.

We don‚Äôt need no ruzzizm‚Ä¶ üéµ",xhgf5b
Fuck this grub talks some shit.,xhgf5b
This has been mentioned multiple times.,xhgf5b
"Sad reality is Russia is NOT a democracy.  Dude can pander all he wants but no, the West isn't buying it.",xhgf5b
"I mean, Russia/Soviet Union are the entire reason NATO even exists.",xhgf5b
Odd posture.  He seems unhealthy.,xhgf5b
I feel like he had some traumas during his childhood.,xhgf5b
"The guy meant to say that Russians wont see it in western media. Considering bill clinton spoke on this topic and we are well aware. What are you doing. Why are you making a fool of yourself üôÑ


Also, hes acting like they let anyone in at all. So let me get this straight putin wanted to join NATO and is waging a war because Ukraine wants to join. ü§£

No i dont want russia in NATO because we dont want to help them rebuild their sick fantasies and enslave people. We dont have the same goals, it doesnt make us enemies, but we arent willing to go to war for you and your ambitions.


Ukraine is not trying to take over all its neigbors and slaughter them.


And now after how many immorale wars Russia has waged. Now, you can join NATO the day after never! None of them not one would i send my son or family to not one. Not Georgia, not Ukraine, not Chechen, and i most certainly do not want to torture Syrians. No, you are right the American people have no interest in joining into youe military ambitions Russia.",xhgf5b
"Hold up how is russia supposed to join NATO, without it NATO expanding.",xhgf5b
If he wants to join NATO he needs to put in an application like every other country did. Did he want some special treatment or something? What kind of stupid question was that.,xhgf5b
He also wanted to be a member of the no Putin‚Äôs club.,xhgf5b
There's a reason we don't see this in western media and that's because it's so easily disputed by a single google search that it isn't worth airing on national television,xhgf5b
So insecure.,xhgf5b
"This is a very well known story in the USA. Before she died, Madeleine Albright wrote about this story in the NYT. They reprinted it after the invasion in February.",xhgf5b
"Yeah I believe him, said nobody ever",xhgf5b
"Wow, his guy really has a victim complex.",xhgf5b
Putina is a lil Butt hurt he didn‚Äôt get to join the club. Stop being a lil biatch and go get yourself promoted to heaven or hell.,xhgf5b
"\*50 years of pointing nuclear weapons at each other\*

""I sure do wonder why they don't want an alliance""",xhgf5b
Maybe if you didnt fucking invade a country and went on a war crime speed run it would have turned out better,xhgf5b
"My takeaway here is Putin has been in power this long? 5 US presidents, is it? More?",xhgf5b
"Like Russia joining the UN, and always complying and being honest to the rest of the council.. we don't want a terrorist state as an ally thanks <3",xhgf5b
When was that speech?,xhgf5b
"This idiot gets confused with his imagination and reality....hell, soon he'll talk about how enjoyable anal-probing by the aliens is.",xhgf5b
"When Russia is attacked by China and Putin needs help, NATO can sit back and laugh.",xhgf5b
This is classic incel behaviour by Putin. Gets rejected by the popular kids so goes and shoots up an elementary school,xhgf5b
"He said, ""what does he think of Russia joining NATO""? that's different from wanting to join NATO",xhgf5b
"Brand new country based on corrupt political oligarchy pops up to replace communist system used to enforce policies used in events like the Holodomor. Wants to join the most powerful military organization in the world. Shocked when it's leader has reservations. Continues to be shocked when commiting numerous war crimes in multiple wars and is treated like the moral enemy. 

Use your brain people.",xhgf5b
what year is this from?,xhgf5b
"But... wasn't NaTo created to whop his ass if he decided to do exactly what he's doing rn?

Was he just trying to make America and NATO come out looking dumb or bad or something",xhgf5b

"I was in a school in 80's in the states where troubled kids around ten and under, where some kids had violent tantrums similar to this, but they were physically restrained by multiple adults  and isolated in separate room. This was in 80's though. Now I think there would be suspenion and intensive psychological intervention, even more so. Child is probably severe adhd with traumas from unprofessionally treated emotional issues.",v010w0
"If he attempted to pull something like that in a Taiwan public school when my friends attended in the '80s, the teacher would have the right to immediately discipline him, the parents would be publicly shamed for raising such an ill-disciplined violent brat, and they'd be looking for a new school to attend.  

Same in Japan during the same period considering one older Japanese friend got expelled in 7th grade for admittedly instigating a fistfight on school grounds.  As no other public or private school in his small rural town was willing to take a ""violent hooligan"" like him and his parents disowned him out of shame over his behavior, he had to eke out a living for several years doing various odd/factory jobs before a wealthy benefactor felt he deserved a second chance and paid for him to finish his schooling through university in the US(No Japanese junior high/high schools wanted to take a chance on what they viewed as a ""violent hooligan"".).

If he attempted to do that in the Catholic elementary schools I attended in the 1980's in the urban NE US, he'd be dragged to the principal's office, parents called in and scolded by principal, and they'd be looking for a new school to attend as they expelled students for far less(I.e. Fidgeting too much at one's desk as a 6 year old first-grader, getting caught stealing other students' stuff 3 times, etc.).",v010w0
Her name is Ukraine and his is Vladimir Putin,v010w0
I wonder what was said by the person recording and the teacher getting abused?,v010w0
"I don't know whether this teacher was trying to be patient, but I would have immediately picked up this kid and hold him upside-down, so that I'm not seen as ""belligerent"" and also simultaneously demonstrate adult dominance.",v010w0

"That seems like some pretty desperate war propaganda. Villifying all Russians, starting with the children? Goebbels smiles in his grave.",v010w0
"Im old school, he would have done that about two seconds to me before i stopped it. Letting kids get away with abusive behavior when they are young is how they grow up to be bullies. Then the kids that are bullied by these kids can't take it anymore and take out a classroom full of kids  when they snap, commit suicide, abuse other people as  adults, etc.",v010w0

Hold up China said they would go to war against Russia ?,ts5fmu
This is bullshit,ts5fmu
China can go fuck itself.,ts5fmu
China actually said that! They literally said today their relationship with Russia has never been stronger and that they want to take it up a level. I'll be shocked if it's true. Do you have a source?,ts5fmu
"I hope that Ukraine applies the same double talk in negotiations Russia does.  Agree to whatever you like but don't sign it.  Remember, Russia won't honor anything that doesn't favor Russia.  They will create a scenario where ""you didn't honor your end, so we will just blow everything up again"".  

You should negotiate only from a position of power and hold the line",ts5fmu
"Funny how they put China on the list when China didn‚Äôt even see anything wrong with Russia‚Äôs invasion. Hell, they knew it was coming and told no one.",ts5fmu
"It shall be called the 

Friendship

Union

Collaborating and sharing

Association",ts5fmu

What is your source? You can't come up with something as far reaching as this without giving a source.,ts5fmu
China?,ts5fmu
"Fucking China? Really? Get them out of this group, they actively colluded with Russia. Xi and Putin were buddying up at the olympics like a week prior to the Ukraine invasion. You don‚Äôt think Xi knew about that? He‚Äôs at worst actively playing both sides and supporting Russia through covert means and at best he is friendly to Russia after all of this. 

With all of their spying, stealing, and genocide of the Uighurs, he‚Äôs no better then Putin in my book. 

Why/who on earth thought adding China to this group was a good idea? I don‚Äôt understand it‚Ä¶ and you know what, why are we waiting until Russia attacks again? If we‚Äôre prepared to do something about Russia in the future then let‚Äôs do something about Russia right now.",ts5fmu
"Nah, I just want them to join NATO and make NATO more badass.  Screw what Russia wants.",ts5fmu
"I don‚Äôt see how this is workable. They‚Äôre proposing a defensive pact with other NATO members ‚Ä¶ but it‚Äôs not NATO? 

What exactly is the difference? Not much. 

The problem is Russia wasn‚Äôt expecting to be in this position in the first place. They were expecting to have the country under domination by now. Russia never cared about NATO, they cared about NATO *preventing them* from taking over Ukraine. Their desires are expansionist in the first place.

I don‚Äôt see any way some kind of watered down multilateral security structure ‚Ä¶ that includes NATO members yet isn‚Äôt NATO is workable, especially if it includes an obviously deceptive two-faced government like Chinas. 

The premise is flawed. Russia won‚Äôt negotiate in good faith because it literally *can‚Äôt*. It signed up for a quick war of conquest and got a meat grinder instead. 

Let‚Äôs even assume some type of agreement is signed tomorrow (a fantasy). We know agreements with Putin aren‚Äôt worth the paper they are signed on, and Ukraine has now suffered something like 500 billion dollars worth of damage to its nation. Who is going to pay this? Russia?  The west? 

I simply see no way forward other than a literal fight till victory, until every single Russian soldier is expelled from the land. The Russians will never stop their campaign for Ukraine unless forced. They‚Äôll only agree to an agreement which lets them dominate Ukraine some other way. 

Sadly there‚Äôs simply no other way but forward to victory now for Ukraine. And for those who are concerned about loss of life, you‚Äôd merely be kicking the can down the road and possibly costing even more loss of life later on. That‚Äôs what appeasement brings. We wouldn‚Äôt be in this mess had the world acted much sooner starting in 2014 (or even before that) when Russia first invaded.",ts5fmu
China stay the fuck home or you will become next Russia,ts5fmu
"It will be interesting to see how the details work out. There's already a similar agreement in place today call The Budapest memorandum however, here we are.",ts5fmu
It's on this link scroll down to the 12.29 post.,ts5fmu
There is ZERO chance that China would do this.,ts5fmu
China ??,ts5fmu
China already made an agreement like this years ago.,ts5fmu
"I see why China would volunteer to this it's trying to push attention away from themselves, they clearly do not want to be sanctioned by the West because they rely mostly on the West, the thing is the West can be entirely self sufficient, the US could be self sufficient if we didn't have idiots in office right now who are like whores selling themselves to the highest bidder aka China, but anyway if only we would focus in the Americas instead of anywhere else this whole hemisphere would be a thriving economic power house, we can easily get oil from Venezuela but it's unfortunate that the current government there is killing their own people and that's a reason why we can't really support Venezuela by becoming a trade partner with them because of their humanitarian issues, aside from oil everything else is pretty much covered in the Americas üåé. It would be awesome to see an American superstate and just unify all of the Americas into one whole American Union, the North American Union was actually a concept not too long ago if I'm not mistaken.",ts5fmu
"Hmmm, I had another idea NATO is a security guarantee, and Ukraine wants security, Russia wants security too from NATO so why not Ukraine stay neutral by choosing both sides NATO and Russia make a buffer state plan where Ukraine and Belarus will host no bases of NATO or Russia and in an event where the other attacks the oppoaing sides counterattacks.",ts5fmu
Solid negative,ts5fmu
So getting the most powerful perk of joining NATO without joining NATO? I can't see Putin agreeing to this if it's part of a peace talk.,ts5fmu
Oh.... so next time you guys will hop right into the fire. How about collectively doing something NOW.,ts5fmu
"It would be a delicious bit of irony, if - 

After going to war to prevent Ukraine from joining NATO,

Ukraine decides not to join NATO - 

because it is now a part of a new alliance of eastern-european countries who feel threatened by Russia, and are much more likely to support each other in case of war.

I'd be thinking of Poland, Ukraine, Baltic states, maybe Finland.  Logistical/armaments backing would come from Germany, USA, UK, along with a nuclear umbrella as a deterrent.  No room for China in this arrangement, not sure what it's doing in the original post.",ts5fmu
Don't trust them. The UK will weasel out of anything it can.,ts5fmu

"I would not worry too much. 

Unlike Russia where everything comes from PooTin the USA has rooms of very capable people that can think and act on their own and are responsible for their own areas of expertise. 

And yes that include China, South China Sea and Taiwan.",ub9j0u
"China is currently in a severe Covid crisis. Citizens are dying left and right‚Ä¶numerous dead in the streets‚Ä¶numerous people committing suicide. I think it‚Äôs safe to say, China have their own magnitude of issues right now, and jumping into war is the absolute worst idea a country with a severely contagious outbreak could possibly do.",ub9j0u
"Jesus, you could have said that with a lot less words. 

Yes. China is certainly thrilled to have to human rights spotlight elsewhere. They‚Äôre probably also thrilled about their ascension relative to Russian descent. They stand to gain in many ways.",ub9j0u
"Our nation isn't a singular dude who can only look in one direction. An invasion now would be lumped in with Russias war of aggression with the narrative already primed for the worst even if the Chinese don't behave as terribly as the Russians have.

Creating a situation where other nations need pick a side might not go nearly as favorably as the Chinese would desire and a China/Russia block is much weaker than the West. China doesn't need a destructive war nor economic isolation its on track if things keep going as is to surpass the US and gain increasing influence over time with softer forms of influence.

They would be incredibly better off waiting until the situation looks even dicier for the US to push and take Taiwan.",ub9j0u
"There are a lot of eyes of all kinds, from countries around the world, steadily watching the Chinese and what they are up to. Just because the media and world politics is focused on russia and Ukraine right now, don't imagine that China isn't being monitored closely. They've also been watching the west and their sanctions on russia during this war, and i rather doubt they want to suffer the same fate just now. 

Finally, the US and other countries have been giving a lot of land-war supplies and weapons to Ukraine, but if the Chinese make a move on Taiwan, the entire US military is still available to respond, including the Pacific Fleet and all of our air force. Any fight for Taiwan would be primarily an air and naval battle, so whatever supplies we've sent to Ukraine wouldn't be much of a factor there.",ub9j0u
"Counter argument: If China wanted this to happen to prep for an invasion of Taiwan, they would be overtly supporting Russia's military and economy directly so as to increase the cost to the west.  I think China's ""soft"" support for Russia is a better indication that they think Putin is acting stupidly and are not ready to have global trade disintegrate into bipolar spheres (west vs rest).  If China was planning something soon, they wouldn't worry about diplomatic implications since the cost of their plans would already have the inevitable fallout baked in.",ub9j0u
"I stop listening when I hear 'hear me out', because what I really hear is 'I don't need Occum and his stinking razor'.  I'm willing to be wrong, it's my knee jerk reaction.",ub9j0u
"Yes, that‚Äôs one of the reasons the US was so hesitant to get involved because we can‚Äôt fight in Ukraine and deal with China if they attacked an ally in Asia.",ub9j0u
"I think though that Russia as a long term irritant was more useful than a few months of hyper focus and then Russia being far more disregarded than before. It was only a decade ago that Mitt Romney Republican candidate for USA president said that Russia not China was our primary geo-political threat. The war with Ukraine really proves how misguided this focus on a paper threat was over a adversary that is growing in power.  
Also a unified Europe, increased military spending by NATO and increase in NATO membership are all against China's long term interest.",ub9j0u
China is busy fighting Covid spread.,ub9j0u
"I think China loves this for different reasons

China  covets Russian natural resources. for the moment they are allies and equal partners. But if Russia is diminished significantly and has to rely on China to survive, Russia becomes more of a junior partner that China can exploit & profit off of, giving China better access & control of Russian oil/gas & minerals",ub9j0u
"Perhaps, but i think in reality with how this conflict has been turning out i don't think China wants this war. One of their if not their biggest military ally has proven to be incompetent, have dated and poorly maintained equipment and regulars with room temperature iq. 

If any world power was worried about russia and their capabilities those worries have now been expunged.",ub9j0u
"Overall yes, but they have to capitalize on it and who know how that will manifest.",ub9j0u

"The significance is not on how many exist vs how many left, the significance is in what losing 5 generals in 20 days means.

And 5 generals in 20 days, means 5 divisions where either so badly defeated or overstretched that their top commander got killed. A general is the commander of a division, and modern generals are not rifle in hand fighting on the trenches. For a general to die, something had to go very wrong for the entire division.

For context, a  division has an average of 10k soldiers. 5 generals dying means that up to 50k soldiers are performing so badly they got their commanding officer killed in action

Edit: As /u/CannedRhino correctly pointed out, a division may has more than 1 general, and we should not assume 190k means 19 divisions and 19 generals, because there are the deputy commanders and staff generals and even then the field army generals, and specially because divisions have not been how commanders move their pieces on the check board for quite a while now, nowadays commanders move smaller more versatile pieces, the so-called battalion tactical groups (Russia) and brigade combat teams(us); these units are commanded by a colonel or a brigadier(1 star general). Consider my math as just a simple explanation on why 5 dead generals in 20 days is a big deal, but don't take those numbers as gospel.

Anyway, if we take a look at the list of killed generals, 2 were field army commanders (a field army contains multiple divisions and is usually comprised of all units acting in one or multiple fronts), 1 was a divisional commanders, 1 was a deputy commander and another a chief of staff. So, whatever the exact math !ay be, losing 2 field army commanders and a division commander in 20 days, in simple terms, is a shitshow.",tkq6ph

"Natural gas. After the introduction of fracking it opened up huge reserves in Ukraine.  They were leaning towards Europe and the west to extract and sell these resources.  It made them a direct competitor with Russia and Russia is a petrostate that depends on European sales to survive.   
When they invaded Crimea, Russia they gained control of a significant part of these new reserves. Problem now is Ukraine cut off Crimea‚Äôs water supply. This was also coming to a head.",tcgzpe
"Can‚Äôt tell you for sure but here‚Äôs some theories I‚Äôve seen: 

-Putin didn‚Äôt want Ukraine to join NATO, so now he‚Äôs ‚Äúdemilitarizing‚Äù them and basically trying to bully them into signing an agreement saying they won‚Äôt join NATO, they‚Äôll reduce their military, won‚Äôt try for nuclear weapons, etc. 

-Putin has been isolated for the last couple of years which has given him time to reflect on what was taken from the Soviet Union. Due to him being surrounded by yes men and him being a prick he‚Äôs convinced himself his army is more powerful than it is. So he thought by flexing his muscles Ukraine would just roll over and take the annex without a fight. And now he‚Äôs deep in the shit since they‚Äôre fighting back, which means he‚Äôs resorting to more brutal techniques to still achieve ‚Äúvictory‚Äù, which would be to have Ukraine as part of Russia again. He was probably banking on a swift victory in Ukraine so he could send his 200k stationed troops to other old Soviet lands to try to annex them too. 

-Ukraine has loads of untapped natural resources that would bring an economic boom to the shitty and declining Russian economy. It was shitty and declining before the invasion, of course now I wouldn‚Äôt wipe my ass with a ruble. 

-Ukraine has a massive and probably younger population that would provide a significant population boost to Russia‚Äôs aging and (for its size) relatively small population. 

-Putin has a terminal illness and this is kind of like his last hoorah to get himself in the history books. 

-He‚Äôs just a fucking prick",tcgzpe

"It's more complicated than this obviously, but imagine you're playing Monopoly against one other person, and Mayfair is the last property left.

Ultimately, Ukraine are unaffiliated, and Russia had to take it to prevent them becoming a direct threat. If Ukraine joins Nato, that's a massive spearhead into Russia. There arebother benefits to Russia. Ukraine also has huge oil reserves, and is a direct route between Russia and Europe for fossil fuel trade. Ukraine is also strangling Crimea by cutting off the fresh water canal.

But ultimately, the Invasion is unwarranted. Diplomacy should have remedied this problems.",tcgzpe
"I explained it a week ago.  Putin doesn't want a democracy next to his kleptocracy (Russia).  Basically, Putin and his close friends own parts of many of the major companies and uses Russia and the companies as his personal cash cow.  They drain the economy and the businesses for their own use.  He wants to establish the Soviet Union all over again and having free democratic neighbors next to Russia are counter to his goal.",tcgzpe
"Putin wants his legacy. It's definitely not about any threat from Ukraine, protecting Russians in the Donbass or Nazis. It's about enlarging Russia, seizing control of Ukraines resources (wheat, uranium, neon gas). Putin is borne from the cold war era - an era where the USSR had an empire and was all powerful. He saw its fall as deeply humiliating and he only has a few years left to do something about it.",tcgzpe
"Realistically we‚Äôre in the last century of nation states as viable entities. As the spheres of influence of the largest players grow until they butt up against eachother there will continue to be hotter and hotter proxy wars between major powers until we‚Äôre left with a single global state.  Our economy, communications networks, and even pop culture are pretty much already global, etc. 

Rationally the thing for the big countries to do is to absorb or prepare to be absorbed. Like cleaning up little pieces of playdough with a bigger piece- mush mush mush. 

Fuck politics and fuck Putin but yeah that‚Äôs the reality, and it‚Äôs why his actions actually do make sense politically even tho they‚Äôre evil af.",tcgzpe
"Nostalgia. He sees former Russian(soviet) leaders as have failed. Egotistic nationalism. Insecurity issues dealing with that ego that is so weak it depends on a history and culture he had no part in. He believes in ideological and cultural superiority. It is safe to say an exsoviet nation saying that culture and and ideology is not so important is a huge threat to that sense of egotistical and pathetic pride of Nationalism. This would be so without or with NATO. The reasons nehind that though require some much more serious mental health conversation I am sure Putin thinks himself too badass to even consider. I am not Ukrainians or Russian not even ethnically. But I have paid very important attention to why people do such horrid things like American slavery, holocaust or cause the needless suffering of the people. This is a common theme with oppressors moreso than tyrants (not exactly exclusive from each other but can be distinguished imo). This is just an opinion as someone who has tried to educated themselves on the topic. I am not anyone with any more valid information than you.",tcgzpe
"Putin has seen an encroachment of NATO and western influence for the last 30 years, he has always said that losing the USSR was a great tragedy and from the start has had ambitions to return Russia to the fullest extent of its power. Putin has always viewed Ukraine as part of Russia and he invaded Ukraine because it used to be a buffer between them and the West but has become increasingly more aligned with the West. From Putin‚Äôs perspective, Ukraine joining NATO or the EU is seen as equivalent to the West invading Russian territory. Putin‚Äôs default strategy is to create an unofficial sphere of influence by co-opting leadership like he has done in Belarus and Syria and by making countries economically dependent on Russia. This strategy didn‚Äôt work in Ukraine and the country democratized and Westernized quickly. He obviously has been preparing for this for years, probably since before the invasion of Georgia, I just don‚Äôt know if he knew exactly when they would invade. Even when he was building up troops on the border, it‚Äôs clear he wasn‚Äôt sure what he wanted to do because he hurt himself by giving Ukraine and the West time to posture and prepare but as soon as the threat of sanctions became unavoidable and without the West ensuring that Ukraine wouldn‚Äôt be allowed in NATO, it‚Äôs clear he felt he had no choice. But explaining why he invaded in the first place is much easier than trying to figure out his endgame which I‚Äôm not sure even Putin knows exactly where this ends",tcgzpe

"Putin really misses the USSR, and has always thought the collapse of it was the worst thing that happened in the 20th century. He‚Äôs made that quite clear. 

He believes all of the former USSR, especially Ukraine, are one people. In other words, he believes that Ukrainians and Russians are the same people and that Ukraine isn‚Äôt a real country or culture.

He also is doing this because he believes the west has hijacked the former communist nations. Because several former communist countries have joined NATO such as Poland and the Baltic countries. He believes Ukraine will be the bridge for NATO to get to Russia. He is mostly doing this in the name of ‚Äúfighting back against threats against Russian security‚Äù. 

It goes back to 2014 when he annexed Crimea, which has a lot of ethnically Russian people which the majority of them wanted to be part of Russia instead of Ukraine. That‚Äôs where this war started pretty much.

To convince the Russian people to invade, Putin makes up a lie that Neo Nazis are running Ukraine and they are backed by America, according to him. He is right that there is a Neo Nazi group in Ukraine, although it‚Äôs very unpopular and in the 2019 elections, it got less than 2% of the vote and it doesn‚Äôt have any seats in the government. So they are not running the country. Not to mention the Ukrainian president is Jewish and had family members who died in the Holocaust. 

So he is doing this to bring back the USSR and possibly has plans to overthrow Zelensky and install a pro Russian president.",tcgzpe
Russia is ass ho,tcgzpe
"He has a vision of a greater Russia‚Äîreturning to the Tzarist empire before the Soviet Union. That means regaining control of many nations, including Ukraine. That is why he has sent troops to Ukraine, Kazakhstan, Belarus, and Georgia. He has discussed this ambition since the early 2000s.

As to why now, myriad of reasons from building up a war chest, modernizing his army, misperception of Western motivation, misperception of Ukrainian will to fight, etc. 

I get frustrated with those who claim Putin is insane. He isn‚Äôt insane. He just believes in a very different world. If you believe Russia should have an empire, his invasion is completely rational. How else would you build a Russian Empire?",tcgzpe
He wants the port at the black sea.,tcgzpe
"Last grasp of an autocratic criminal oligarchy with a failing military. A successful Ukraine shows how corrupt and useless the Russian leadership is for the Russian people. Russia wants to take whatever resources it can from Ukraine to prop up their own positions of power, sort of like a Ponzi scheme.",tcgzpe
"USSR, a autocratic and mob style government collapsed under its own corruption and incompetence. Under the collapse, it lost a lot of power and thusly influence around the world. Putin who grew up in said lifestyle has a dream of restoring that prestige. But unfortunately for Russia the former satellite states chose to break away and become sovereign, while a small few clinged on. There were agreements between the west and the easy about keeping a balance of power as to maintain an air if stability and peace between rivaling powers. But naturally there are covert wars being run for political influence. And naturally governments saw west as a more reasonable partner in economic and political stability. Enter Putin, who basically secured his reign over a supposed democratic Russian Federation through old soviet maneuvers. He calls upon violations of old agreements to stoke his crusade to make Russia Federation ( soviet union 2.0 ) great again, by usurping sovereign nations formerly under russias influence. There are several economic factors involved but primarily for ukraine, it secures an energy corridor to the west and eliminates some energy rivals in eastern Europe. It also serves as a ground buffer for land invasions, but i believe this is more of an excuse because if ww3 were to happen it most definitely will be an air war, and potentially a nuclear catastrophe",tcgzpe

"Many reasons that we don‚Äôt fully know as citizens.
UKR used to be part of Russia and the USSR and the country is loaded with natural gas and oil. It‚Äôs enough to put them in 2nd&3rd place for exports. If UKR get to be free from Russia and more NATO friendly it would greatly damage russia exports and economy, where if UKR is part of Russia, it‚Äôs all theirs and it increases their power and wealth.
Additionally, there‚Äôs a long history of USA and the west implementing their views on the world and governments and it contradicts traditional values of the East. As the west grows and grows it is seen as an intentional take over if the world narrative, (which it does).
Additionally, the US has a habit in the East of trying to over throw governments and installing western friendly regimes, which the US played a major role in back in 2014 in UKR and that really set Putin off and he sees that we will not stop doing this. Don‚Äôt forget China doesn‚Äôt like us much either lol.

"I cannot find independent verification of this, which tells me that youtube channel is BS. I think it came from an assumption made by journalists such as [this article](https://news.yahoo.com/congress-sends-40-billion-ukraine-184213078.html). The journalist just assume that we will  include the patriot system which is highly unlikely since it requires extensive training to use and there is to high of a risk of it falling in Russian hands. 

Instead what i found was that we are sending Slovakia, a NATO country,  [Patriot missiles batteries](https://defence-blog.com/nato-deploys-patriot-system-to-slovakia-amid-russias-invasion-of-ukraine/) because they sent their S-300 systems to Ukraine.",uuw3jk

"Here's what you need to know: 
1) Putin is a liar.  How many time in the last month did he say he wasn't going invade Ukraine? 
2) Putin is a war criminal.  Ukraine had not threatened or attacked Russia.  Yet, Putin invaded.  This is a war crime.
3) The appartment building hit by a missile... Russia claims it was a Ukrainian SA missile that went awry.... even *if*  IF this were true, Putin single handedly cause this chain of events to happen.
4) Putin is a murderer.   You need only look as far as the Russian Security Council meeting last week.  All of his people are deathly afraid of him.",t2hxz4
"Its because Russia is using dirty tactics to make it look like the Ukraine soldiers are attacking their own people.

The Russian media is being manipulated and controlled. Believeing anything that comes from Russia is not advised. They've bombed children's hospitals and used Ukrainian soldier uniforms to make it look like they're attacking their own people.

I really hope your loved ones are okay.",t2hxz4
Information is definitely foggy but Russia has been proven to lie over and over again. They cannot be trusted for any information about their invasion.,t2hxz4

Putin is a liar and an evil fucking human being. Start from there.  Everything after is easy.,t2hxz4
Truth is probably somewhere in between. Wait a while. They won‚Äôt release actual facts till it‚Äôs over.,t2hxz4
"To sum it up:
1 - Ukraine has newly discovered oil and natural gas reserves that threaten Russia's energy monopoly on Europe.
2 - Ukraine is pro-Western, and Putin does not want a potential NATO country so close to his Caucasian oil fields.
3 - Ukraine was increasingly becoming more powerful and wealthy, while Russia is going the opposite direction. The choice was to attack now and keep Crimea or never.
4 - Putin lied and came up with a pretext to invade Ukraine and overthrow the democratically elected government. Russia had absolutely no right to invade, and now innocent people will die to satisfy Putin's ego and his lust for power.

5 - This looks atrocious for Russia, and it may permanently damage Russia's image abroad. Expect a drastic increase in anti-Russian sentiment, even in traditionally pro-Russian countries. The economic and social backlash against Russia will be tremendous and I believe it will cause havoc in Russia.
6 - Putin will become more deranged and isolated as the pressure builds on him. Expect more repression of free speech and other civil liberties.

Stay away from Russian government-run media. They are forces to push an agenda and it is biased and misleading propaganda",t2hxz4
The only bearing you need to process this event is realizing that Putin repeatedly said this was only a military exercise and people were being histerical... and then turned it into all out war.,t2hxz4
"Simple answer, if everyone says Putin bad except Russia, it means Putin bad... And by effect, Russians look bad. It's nearly every country on Earth against Russia, that should tell you something.",t2hxz4
"Russia has no free media like us in the US, everything is state controlled so pretty much Putin gets to say yes or no to all war news and he can spin it however he likes. He‚Äôs also been using heavy propaganda on the Russian people for years now. Fuck Putin and Glory to Ukraine",t2hxz4
"Well, for starters, considering the Kremlin have been lying through their teeth all along leading up to the invasion, I wouldn't trust any Russian source.",t2hxz4
Can your family from Russia even say anything bad without winding up on a list?,t2hxz4
"Russian perspective. 

Add distance between Russia and the west in order to safeguard from invasion and re unite the old lands of the Soviet Union in order to assert ourselves in the world as we have lost a lot of power (basically)

Reason for adding distance, (russia is literally a flat plain it‚Äôs not hard to make swift and aggressive troop movements, this is why every campaign into the heart of Russia was initially successful)

I would also like to note, probably no Russian civilian in their right mind actually supports this view, sanctions from invading crimes years ago and invading ukraine today are destroying the economy and send many into poverty and despair within Russia. 

Ukrainian perspective 

We just got independent after hundreds of years of occupation by different empires and dictatorships and were fighting for our right to exist.",t2hxz4
"Do you speak/read Russian? If you browse Russia media sites/live news streams on YouTube you will see the Russian narrative, which is known to have orders to only report on official Russian-sourced information, has their own spin on every single little detail of this conflict.

For me, falling down this sick rabbit hole happened shortly before the invasion occurred. I read English language (either US or European, don't remember, as I read both) news talking about the increasing propaganda in Russia that was denying all rumors of a planned invasion, which made me look into it myself. Russian media was parroting all the information we ALL heard around the world, that they were conducting military drills on their own soil, it was their own business, there was no plan of attack, Western hysteria, etc.

As an example of the above, [here is an article](https://ren.tv/news/v-mire/935887-agentstvo-bloomberg-po-oshibke-soobshchilo-o-vtorzhenii-na-ukrainu) (in Russian) from 5 February describing how the Bloomberg news agency published a false report of Russian attack on Ukraine. Bloomberg was forced to apologize, explaining they had several news headlines ready for different courses of events. This Russian article parroted all the same information, referring to it as ""the imaginary threat to Ukraine"", quoting the Kremlin as saying ""this does not threaten anyone and should not worry anyone"", and even alleging that ""reports of Russian aggression are a pretext for deploying NATO military equipment near Russia's borders"".

Russia's 60 Minutes television show was reporting on the tension in the Donbass with the same classic Russian claims.

The moment of the initial ""peacekeeping"" announcement and ordering of troops into the ""independent"" Eastern separatist states, I asked a Russian living in a border oblast (Belgorod Oblast) half-jokingly how the war was going. He replied entirely casually, matter-of-factly, even calmly, that *""Well yeah, we are going in to keep the peace. There are Fascists in Ukraine causing harm. They will kill you there just for being Russian. We are going in as peacekeepers. Refugees have already arrived in my town.""*

This is what first made me understand that they have entirely their own narrative for these events, and the Russian population may be believing it in unison. The claims of peacekeeping, denazifying, causing no threat to civilians, disarming the Ukrainian military, we have all read at least some references to these in all our media, I think. Putin's speeches have made no secret of this narrative, and the Foreign Minister Lavrov's first press conference (I believe that was Day 2 of the invasion) also referred to it.

By the way, if you understand Russian, watch Lavrov's first press conference, which occurred during actual war. Listen to the way he and some female voice crack inappropriate jokes about the journalists trying to ask questions. An English speaking journalist (may have been CNN) tried to cut in out of order to ask a question, because he said he was ""in a precarious position in Kiev"". Lavrov cracked a joke that ""he is stationed in Ukraine. They have infected him with impoliteness"". Then a Chinese journalist who had been cut off earlier frantically tried to cut in with her question, and a female voice is heard in Russian literally joking with a chuckle at her - it is hard to paraphrase from Russian exactly but she basically laughed at the journalist for sounding so frantic. As if people weren't looking for answers during a literal European war. Later the same CNN(?) journalist from Kiev finally got to ask his question. It was a poor connection and he repeated himself a few times because we could hardly make out every other word. He asked straight out whether Russia's goal was to decapitate the government and install a pro-Russian regime. Lavrov's response? First he mocked him by saying ""are you going to ask it for a third time? I already understood it the first time"" and then referred him to listen to Putin's speech, which outlined all the answers. He even further mocked the journalist for not listening or reading enough to already have known the answer to his question. He made a mocking suggestion that the journalist spend more time reading/listening to the information already dispersed. Seems like an extremely appropriate time for Russia's Foreign Minister to be mocking journalists instead of answering serious questions with straight answers in a serious tone, right?",t2hxz4
"Easy. Every damn thing Putin says is a lie. That pathetic man‚Äôs existence is an insult to humanity, truth, and justice. The Russian invasion of Ukraine is a crime that the whole world must resist and condemn in the strongest terms.",t2hxz4
"Trying to get the exact truth in the midst of Russia's invasion of Ukraine is difficult. There is one basic uncontested fact; Putin ordered the invasion. So, did it matter who's equipment did what damage inside of Ukraine? No, because none of it would have happened if Putin kept his troops in Russia. The tank hitting the car? The tank and car wouldn't have been sharing a road. A missile and an apartment building? There would be no missiles in the sky if Putin kept Russian troops outside of Ukraine.",t2hxz4
"You‚Äôre witnessing a fair amount of propaganda which in today‚Äôs day and age and in times of war, has proven to be much more influential when coupled with general misinformation and unconfirmed reporting running rampant on social media.

Be skeptical of everything and try to wait for confirmation before believing a headline.",t2hxz4
"I do think that was a Ukrainian Strela that ran over the car. Watching the full video it may have been an accident since there was a shootout happening at the same time. Since the Ukrainian soldiers nearby don‚Äôt seem too concerned with the fact that a Russian strela is driving right next to them and since they just killed the saboteurs you‚Äôd think they‚Äôd be worried about such a thing if it was taken over.

Also there were not Russian armor in downtown Kiev the other day.",t2hxz4
"Propaganda is a powerful tool in leading up to war and during a conflict. Putin has shown over the years that he is a master of deception and propaganda. Hitler took over Germany by means of controlling media and propaganda. If the entire world is against you (Putin, in this case) then one needs to look no further than at himself for blame. Putin must be stopped, the world knows it and a growing population of the Russian population knows this as well. He simply must be stopped by whatever means necessary.",t2hxz4
"I think it‚Äôs important to differentiate between reiterating facts vs a thoroughly researched opinion. The latter requires looking at both sides of media and feeling unsure like you do and then laying out the probabilities of which is more true vs not. I would personally be cautious of who you believe and give higher weight to people who have gone through what you‚Äôre going through‚Ä¶ who have heard both sides and can give you a more balanced opinion. 

There is a mental model for higher level thinkers where you can only assert an opinion after you‚Äôve heard both sides and can argue either side better and more convincingly than the top 5% of people. That is, you can convince someone not familiar with the situation to believe either side. That imo is when you have an informed and balanced decision.

In my own take, if you watch the stuff zolenskyy says vs what putin says, they address it directly. ‚ÄúSomeone is lying‚Äù you can decide who and also keep in mind the current situation where people are dying to defend their homeland and the history of what people have done",t2hxz4

OP and the rest of his fellow Russian should be feeling the pain of the sanctions.  Here in America, they are not.

Or how refugees are welcome now but often weren't before.

I certainly hope this war will end asap and Putin will be dealt with. But afterwards the whole world (especially the ""democratic"" part) needs to rethink, well, where the entire humanity is going, how we deal with decisions and how we let things happen.

Just how after WWII things went in a different general direction than after WWI.

"Problem is we did a shit job keeping watch and decided that the US having an army and no-one else was a good idea because de-militarization looks good for politicians. All those European/EU countries have significantly smaller militaries and had no plans of increasing their size until Russia finally invaded instead of forcing Russia to actually keep her distance by properly arming themselves and allowing Ukraine into NATO or the EU or the UN, instead of acting like pansies to Russia. The US under Bill Clinton actually made the Ukrainian military GET RID of their military to ""appease"" Russia. Appeasement never works.",t5wd0r
"NATO should have been disbanded together with the Warsaw Pact of the 1990s, and this would not have happened. Leading NATO countries have taken advantage of the weakness of previous Russian authorities and broken a promise to ban NATO expansion east of Germany. This war is a direct consequence of these violated guarantees in an attempt to completely surround Russia on the European side. America is waging war on distant continents under the pretext of its own security, and Russia should calmly watch as enemy forces pile up in its backyard. Unfortunately, in the case of Ukraine as the last buffer zone between Russia and NATO, things got out of control after the coup and the violent change of government in 2014. No attempt was made to negotiate and now it has escalated to the worst. It is blind to say that this is a war between Ukraine and Russia.",t5wd0r

"This is a poor assessment, my guy. Ukraine has been bombing Crimea for months now. That is ""russian territory"" to them and they haven't done shit. They ain't GONNA do shit. They're gonna force hundreds of thousands of conscripts and reservists into action right as winter starts and they're going to starve, suffer, freeze, and die because Russia can't even supply the 100k troops it has in Ukraine as is. Russian troops are pillaging towns for food. No one is restocking those houses. In winter they will be empty.",xjfofy
They won‚Äôt use nukes for this they will lose so much more and they will really be up against the might of the whole free world if they even attempt to use nukes and plus everyone knows it is not mainland Russia so the whole world would be against it which will further solidify support for Ukraine in this fight‚Ä¶,xjfofy

"You're an idiot.  Russia will not use nukes.  Ukraine will take their lands back because these referendums are not legal. Nothing Putin does is going to stop people of Ukraine kicking Russian occupiers out of ""their"" country.",xjfofy
">That will mean that if Ukraine continues its counteroffensive in Kherson and Donbass Russia will be able to use its nuclear arsenal according to their own nuclear doctrine.

Nothing would have stopped them using them earlier, nothing would stop using them in the future even without referendum. Unfortunately for Russia, using them would have triggered a western response and it will still trigger a western response, no matter how much kool referendum aid Putin drank.",xjfofy
Smoothbrain take,xjfofy
"You know who else has nukes?  NATO.  Where's that nuclear fallout going to drift towards?  NATO.  


Russia wants to start a nuclear war simply because they don't want to actually fight, that's their problem, but DON'T be surprised when other nuclear powers use their nukes on Russia to gain additional territory.",xjfofy
How do you reason they will use nuclear weapons in a country they intend to occupy indefinitely exactly?,xjfofy
Why didn't they did something like that when Ukraine bombed Crimeea?,xjfofy
"Lol. Russia isn't using nukes on Ukraine. If any fallout lands on a NATO country, Article 5 will be invoked. If they mobilize, it will be for troop numbers only. They can't fill their ranks with career soldiers and prisoners.",xjfofy
"Not even Putin is that crazy, nuclear weapons are a last resort defense, not offensive.

Can you imagine the amount of bordering countries that'll go against Russia if they decide to do that. That entire continent of Asia will be outrageously polluted for hundreds of years.

And even If Russia *did* decide to nuke Ukraine, what does Russia get from it, a useless piece of land and the entire planet disapproving their strategy even more.

Russia pushes the Nuke Button, expect an all out catastrophe from every other nuclear power on this planet, it won't happen, even Russia knows that.",xjfofy
Because until this they didn't think they could invade?  lol.,xjfofy
"Russia has been posturing about using nukes for months. They have not done shit and will continue to not do shit. 

Putin is quickly becoming so unpopular, even with the military leadership, any order to launch may very well be ignored and become the point that force a military coup. Reports have been saying Putin is responsible for forcing the military to take on forced conscripts, including prisoners rather than mobilizing.",xjfofy
Fuck their nuclear doctrine.  That land will always be Ukraine and we will respond decisively if they use nukes.  The referendum means NOTHING.  It changes NOTHING.,xjfofy
"My estimate is that the US would fairly immediately strike political and military targets within russia were they to use tactical nuclear weapons. I think the extent of those strikes would depend on the number of weapons russia deployed, but I believe it would be a powerful enough counter that the military would likely turn on Putin at that point and refuse additional nuclear strikes and/or stage a coup.",xjfofy
"I think we are past that point, now.

Russia is a bully, not truly insane. For example, they were all about the threats when Finland and Sweden showed interest in NATO, but when push came to shove, they sat down and shut up. 

Nothing is stopping Ukraine from reclaiming *their* territory and from everything that I've read, they have every intention of doing so. 

There comes a point where you have to draw the line and it seems that point is right here and now. 

If Russia want's to start WWIII, then we'll have WWIII. It would be tragically unfortunate should that occur, but that's just the way it is. 

Odds are, though, they are just a bully and threats are all that they are going to do. This ""referendum"" is purely for internal consumption because they *know* that nobody outside of Russia considers it valid. 

When the fake referendum is pushed through, it means when Ukraine ""invades"" Russia can declare war and use conscripts to ""defend their borders"". 

There will be no nukes. They are just going to start hauling able bodied (by their definition) people off of the streets of Moscow, handing them a fifty year old AK or shoving them into a T-34 and driving them like so many pigs to the abattoir.

This will be tragic and needlessly prolong the war, but on the bright side, there will be fewer russian trolls clogging up the internet, if you know what I mean.",xjfofy
"Kinda. 

You're right it gives them more leverage to lean in, particularly for theor own population. And it allows them to draw NEW lines in the sand and say ""don't you dare cross this new line"" but that's just saber rattling, and a continuation of everything they've been doing all this time.

I doubt Ukrane stops at the occupied territory borders just because Russia said ""you can't do it! We've voted now, you must stop""",xjfofy
"I'm putting my hopes here on Uncle Xi. I really hope he told Putin that nukes are absolutely, completely, ""don't even think about it"" off the table. He already isn't happy about the war at all and nukes would hopefully push China into open opposition.",xjfofy
They think it will. But it will not.,xjfofy
"I don't know if 'wish a mothafucka would' is a popular or unpopular opinion.. but if this happens then we can look forward to only 1 thing.... Zelensky for President of RF!

It doesn‚Äôt say, ‚Äòsome men‚Äô; it says ‚Äòall men.‚Äô It doesn‚Äôt say ‚Äòall white men‚Äô; it says ‚Äòall men,‚Äô which includes black men. It does not say ‚Äòall Gentiles‚Äô; it says ‚Äòall men,‚Äô which includes Jews. It doesn‚Äôt say ‚Äòall Protestants‚Äô; it says ‚Äòall men,‚Äô which includes Catholics. It doesn‚Äôt even say ‚Äòall theists and believers‚Äô; it says ‚Äòall men,‚Äô which includes humanists and agnostics.‚Äù
July 4th 1964


I say to you today, my friends , so even though we face the difficulties of today and tomorrow , I still have a dream.  It is a dream deeply rooted in the American dream.

I have a dream that one day this nation will rise up and live out the true meaning of its creed : ‚ÄúWe hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal.‚Äù

I have a dream that one day on the red hills of Georgia, the sons of former slaves and the sons of former slave owners will be able to sit down together at the table of brotherhood.

I have a dream that one day even the state of Mississippi, a state sweltering with the heat of injustice, sweltering with the heat of oppression, will be transformed into an oasis of freedom and justice.

I have a dream that my four little children will one day live in a nation where they will not be judged by the color of their skin but by the content of their character. I have a dream today.

I have a dream that one day down in Alabama, with its vicious racists , with its governor having his lips dripping with the words of ‚Äúinterposition‚Äù and ‚Äúnullification‚Äù , one day right there in Alabama little black boys and black girls will be able to join hands with little white boys and white girls as sisters and brothers. 

I have a dream today.

I have a dream that one day every valley shall be exalted, every hill and mountain shall be made low, the rough places will be made plain, and the crooked places will be made straight, and the glory of the Lord shall be revealed, and all flesh shall see it together. 

This is our hope. This is the faith that I go back to the South with. With this faith we will be able to hew out of the mountain of despair a stone of hope. With this faith we will be able to transform the jangling discords of our nation into a beautiful symphony of brotherhood. 

With this faith we will be able to work together, to pray together, to struggle together, to go to jail together , to stand up for freedom together, knowing that we will be free one day.

"The most brutal ones have been from the poorest Asian communities on the outskirts of Russia. Those communities have a different very poor way of life and very little choice in improving their standing. I believe if Russia was more confined to its soldier pool being from Moscow and St Peter, they would have better results as far as pillaging and raping. One of the results of this war should be a wake up call to those communities due to their overwhelming losses, they should split from Russia and not be involved in supporting their puppet governments.",ukyfwc
Yeah we know. No one is fooling themselves except Russian nationalists. What is the point of this post.,ukyfwc
It's basically cannon fodder being paid in rape opportunities or associations. People refrain from ranting about it because theyve been betrayed by their deranged leaders and it's disgrace to whole world defying harsh enough description mostly.,ukyfwc

"Lol I was never fooled. Within the first week I was affirmed without the benefit of doubt that Russia is absolute trash.. I say Russia instead of the army because its fighters are just an expression of recent and current Russian norms. Russia is a never was, not even a has been. Ukraine has heart, it‚Äôs fucked in its own way but it doesn‚Äôt bleed into the very fabric of its existence. They want better. They want their Nation and Statehood to be independent from the oppression and destructive influences of Russia. Hell morally Ukraine is actually better than the major Nation States supporting them considering a few of them are colonial perpetualists themselves where the original people are systematically oppressed these countries have engaged in similar tactics and strategies that Russia is employing to exist. Ukraine is fighting the good fight. Needless to say Russia will implode and a new Nation will organize under true peace and freedom.
Be Brave Fight Like Ukraine.",ukyfwc
The US needs to train and provide Patriot missiles to ukraine,ukyfwc

"It's not exactly that: the performance of the last 2 months is real shit, but every other army in the world, with the same lacking of planning, preparation, leadership, logistics and organizations would probably have performed the same. We'll see in the next weeks if the approach will change totally. I obviously hope that they will still do a bad performance, but don't make the error of evaluate the russian army based on the last two months of war.",ukyfwc

Let's see *you* run a more successful invasion of a European country. Show Russia how it's done!,ukyfwc
They‚Äôre also fucking stupid and telegraph everything they plan on doing. I think of Ukraine‚Äôs preparation for this war like if a neighborhood bully nobody likes threatens the innocent quiet kid and the Class President who is also the quarterback of the football team decides to start working out with and studying with the kid every night after school. And then the popular guy‚Äôs friends put the kid on a high protein diet and enroll him in karate. Then the cool kids find out quiet kid is cool as fuck and want to hang out with him after this ordeal is over the popular guy started a rumor the quiet kid is hung because they showered together after training and the rest of school wants to get to know this kid more. It‚Äôs not gonna good for Russia.,ukyfwc
I'm just surprised at how bad they really are.,ukyfwc

"Video shows what Ruzzian state has lost in this war.  almost 90% of its best paratroopers killed/disabled during battles (914 documented deaths) of hostomel Airport, Vasylkiv air base, Bucha, Kyiv, Kharkiv and,  Mykolaiv.  Reduced to light support infantry, lost 2 high ranking commanders (Sergei Sukharev,  Sergei Krylov, Andrei Sukhovetsky) and being used like a sealing rag on the front...  Best of ruzzian forces were obliterated by Ukrainian National Guard's rapid response brigade and air force at Hostomel Airport and then further reduction took place. Circa 20th July 2022 they are no longer capable to perform any operation due to loss of equipment and personnel. 
Is this movie something to brag about?  It shows how good they were before Ukrainian forces smashed them and they scattered in the woods.  Day after their first failure they came back with more choppers (200) and ground forces and took now disabled and damaged airstrip...  Well done. If being encircled,  beaten and scattered is what they were trained for.  It will take years to form new VDV forces.  Let's hope we will never see them again.",wtlni9

Haha they were so hyped up and thought they‚Äôre gonna be total badasses crushing Ukrainian peasants in a couple of days. Now pretty much all the human waste you see in this video is dead turned into fertilizer. The ultimate ‚Äúdon‚Äôt underestimate your enemy‚Äù moment.,wtlni9
wonder how many of these are dead or maimed...,wtlni9
"Will love to see the Ukrainian POV to this battles from the first days of the war..

"With the start of this stupid was, Russia exposed how weak they are after failing to capture Kyiv with Ill planned supply support and troops. Now we can see how Turkey is taking advantage of this in Azerbaijan/Armenia war and pretty sure in Syria if I‚Äôm not mistaken. The fact Azerbaijan attacked Armenia( Russian Allie) when Russia is struggling in Ukraine is a master stroke from Turkey( Azerbaijan Allie). What do you guys think? 
           I used to think Putin a smart leader when he annexed crimea, 3 states from Georgia and the chachen war but he over reached when he invaded Ukraine.",xptyu8
"If you're looking for pure, wild-assed guesses, that's a good title to go with.",xptyu8
"The Russian army will be defeated in the field. Putin is long past the point where he can gracefully extract himself from this disaster and we have reached just a matter of time before the rotten edifice of Russian corruption can no longer be supported by the rusting bones of Soviet military expenditure.

Then when some breaking point is crossed the Russian army will limp home and Putin's regime will come to a violent end.",xptyu8
"This very much depends on two things- Ukrainian success on the battlefield and the Russian domestic situation. Perversely, the former = escalation and a potentially larger longer war. Russia, all other things equal, isn't just going to give up. Even if Putin is deposed, it is likely that would be carried out by ultra nationalists who will install a leader who will not want to be seen as weak. The war therefore deals on. While we are all willing Ukraine on, their continued success actually ups the stakes for the rest of Europe given the likelihood of tactical nukes being used. That would bring NATO into the fray which in turn could bring China in, giving it the green light to invade Taiwan while the US is preoccupied with the European theatre. The term world war 3 is banded around a lot but we truly are very close to it here. A NATO - Russo/Sino world war, even if it stays conventional (ber the use of tactical in Ukriane) would be devastating - a war on the scale of WW2 globally which will kill millions, with economic apocalypse. The second thing is the Russian domestic situation. We can only hope that Russians, upon the dawn of nuke use and NATO involvement, decide the time has come to topple Putin and negotiate given that the war is increasingly unpopular, the economy is suffering and they don't fancy WW3 and or nuclear annihilation. Scary times indeed.",xptyu8
"I've been following this war from day one, we are 7 months into this war and Russia is running low on supplies, it can't make new tanks or IFVs, it cant make any new missiles and it cant properly train new troops and we are seeing the results of all of that, moral is in the shitter for Russians and even the Russian people are questioning this war more and more and winter will soon be here and this will test the troops, especially the new consripts, their resolve and if they make it through the winter then they'll have to contend with whatever deal the US lend-lease was offered which will be concluded in Autumn (fall for you Yanks). Now, this is important as the US has stated that western tanks and Jets are not off the table in this deal and as it's a Lend-Lease deal, a lot of stuff will probably get sent over because thats the point so hopefully this will see the creation of new divisions with Western tanks (most likely Abrams) and possibly other Western heavy vehicles that will all require training on and this winter will be the perfect time for it all and by March, Ukraine will be ready for a massive counter attack against a demoralised and out of supply Russian force and retake the land.  


I should also point out that Western intelligence believes that Russia only has 42% of its missile stockpile left meaning that in a years time, they'll only have sticks and stones to throw at the Ukrainians.",xptyu8
"With all of Ukraine including Crimea liberated, the war will end within five to ten years, or however long it takes Putin to die.",xptyu8
"Russia doesnt have that long, lol",xptyu8
"At least a few years if Ukraine is going to liberate Crimea, i can See this turn into a much bigger war once Ukraine starts to liberate Crimea, Russia uses all it‚Äôs forces as defence.",xptyu8
"Russians love anniversaries- December 23, 2022, days after Putin falls out a window dying from multiple self inflicted gunshots to the head.",xptyu8
"Unfortunately, i think they gona nuke ukraine, small nuke behind the front lines. God knows what going to happen after",xptyu8
Nukes will not be used. There will be a coup. New leadership will not own the decision to invade and win. Russia returns to 2014 borders in a negotiated retreat.,xptyu8
"The war will last as long as Putin does. So we're really just waiting for his associates to kill him, the timing of which is something we can't exactly predict. More Russian deaths, more major failures on the battlefield - eventually those things will be motivational enough for some military or oligarchy heavy-hitters to deal with him.

Even then, his successor will probably need to continue the war for a bit, just a Russian political thing.",xptyu8
Collapse? ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èü§£,xptyu8
This war will go on until either Russia and Ukraine come to an agreement or Russia collapses. It will probably go on for many years at least.,xptyu8
"Theirs so many different directions it could go it's difficult to say. I don't believe Russia has the capabilities of taking Ukraine without waging all out war on them, in which case it'll be the classic Russian way of dealing with problems; throw enough people at it until it's fixed. Even so, I don't think they could do so without external help. 

My guess is they'll fight through the winter. Pending on how the winter campaign goes, come spring, they might just declare victory and return there soldiers to ""annexed"" territory. Russia knows Ukraine won't take back that territory if the USA pulls military aid support. I believe the west will pursue Ukraine to take the deal, exchanging POW's for land back. This way it avoids widening the conflict, Putin won't be forced to act on his bluffs, and the paper tiger continues to stand. 

I'm more so curious as to whether or not Russia will be able to recruit (or kidnap lol) western trained Ukrainian troops to overhaul its own troops training programs. Ontop of the excess western equipment, they might even be able to further develop there own future weapons to counter any future western advances in the region.",xptyu8
Putin going to falls out of the window really soon.,xptyu8
I fear that MAD will be the end of it,xptyu8
Why do people keep asking this? Have you not seen the sub name? Done by the end of the year.,xptyu8
"3 more years, many more actors. Many lives lost.",xptyu8
"I‚Äôm going to tell you a secret‚Ä¶
Ready‚Ä¶
No one knows. Not even the talking heads. Predictions are made and discarded in days.",xptyu8
Who knows. But it‚Äôs quite obvious at this point that Russia‚Äôs nuclear program has been infiltrated by allies. So nukes are not an ending that‚Äôs remotely possible.,xptyu8
War will end when all Russians will be killed and die in agony,xptyu8
"It will last until the will of the Russian people is broken, they refuse to fight, and they go back home while Putin screeches impotently from a palace hidden in the woods somewhere.

He will continue to scream orders as his staff starts to leave, abandoning him in a progressively more empty mansion.

In the end, he will be alone, consumed by madness and illness, wandering the empty halls of an abandoned palace ""launching nukes"" and making phone calls to people who stopped answering months ago.",xptyu8
"Putin already shot himself in the foot a few times.  How will he end it?  He'll shoot himself in the head. i.e. he'll use nukes which will ultimately lead to his demise.  The first time he uses them, the US will have the green light to supply nukes to Ukraine, and then it will be the end of putin and a very bloody nose for Russia.",xptyu8
"In short, quickest way for war to end would be if The Russian public revolted against the regime. Millions of Russians protesting on the streets could help bring about a coup. Then, next challenge, the replacement president cant be as bad as Putin",xptyu8
"I don't think Russia ends this... Ukraine does. Russia is a hot mess right now. I think in time Georgia and Kazakhstan and possibly Chechnya use a floundering Russia as a sign (along with promised support from the west) to make a move for their own independence from Russia. I think the borders are soon to be closed with forced mobilization and mass surrenders to Ukraine. The powers that be in Russia are put to the test and Pootin is taken out and Russians finally elect somebody with a brain and beg for forgiveness from the world. 

At least I hope this happens...as far as a timeline..not this winter but the death throws of this Russian war by the winter after that.",xptyu8
"Putin mobilize hundreds of thousands of people to justify to his own all the losses they experienced, a tactical nuke will be used and Ukraine will advance no more.",xptyu8
From the beginning I assumed a couple decades.  20-30 years minimum.,xptyu8
"I don‚Äôt know what will happen, but I do know what the most sensible thing would be. The Russians have one obvious way out and that is to blame it all on Putin. Retreat immediately, help bring the perpetrators of war crimes to the Hague and open up their weak economy. The population can simply claim ignorance and said they didn‚Äôt know what Putin was doing and that they too were a victim to his regime. Unfortunately not very likely this will happen though..",xptyu8
"The mobilisation and ‚Äúreferenda‚Äù I believe show that that Putin wants this thing wound down soon. I think we‚Äôll see the end of the special military operation very soon, victory declared, and then Russia will simply defend its new border, with Ukraine continuing to take back pieces until war fatigue sets in and eventually they have to accept it but maintain their claim to it. They‚Äôll then Join the EU (similar to Cyprus with a portion occupied by a non-EU country).

I don‚Äôt see Russia using a nuke. They didn‚Äôt in Afghanistan & I don‚Äôt believe they will here because they cannot beat Ukraine and therefore they have no chance against NATO. They have zero to gain from using a nuke.",xptyu8
"Negotiated truce with Crimea going to Russia, with that only happening due to a harsh winter in the EU leading to a push for negotiations. 
Before then the Russian army will be humiliated even more due to unhappy conscripts flooding the ranks.",xptyu8
Russian revolution of the greatest intensity. Some of us are freedom fetishists like myself and we try to do things that bring awareness to Russian resistance and make it eat itself from the inside out.,xptyu8
Unsure and surrender.,xptyu8
"The current Russia will not do anything to end it. They are the aggressor, and recently increased the aggression (by drafting lots of new soldiers).

Diplomatically I see no way to make this war get ended. Would Russia try to adhere to diplomatic agreements, there wouldn't be a war in the first place: in the Budapest Treaty they signed to be a guard for the security of Ukraine, and not to attack it.

So there must be either tremendous internal changes happening inside Russia, or a complete victory of Ukraine happen for this war to end. The 2nd thing is the more likely (yet much more costly) outcome.",xptyu8
"The war won't last more than a few more weeks or months, because as soon as the nuclear threshold is crossed, it will all be over within days.

Putins next move will be an attempt to decapitate the West with a strike on DC of some sort. It may start with an EMP attack, followed by the detonation of their nuclear torpedoes off the coast of New York, San Diego, etc. I also feel that Warsaw will be hit as a way to draw a line in the sand.

The Russian attack will result in a nuclear counterattack from the West.

""If the fight is inevitable, be the first to strike""
- Vladimir Putin",xptyu8
"money. China has lost trillions on Silk Road. Russia can‚Äôt buy a victory. Putin will accept a Black Sea Guantanamo a‚Äôla Kaliningrad or be killed sooner. MAD is ensured by a global monied elite that can‚Äôt be without their yachts and private jets. It‚Äôs the multinational 1% that runs things now, Putin bet against the house. Full stop.",xptyu8

Frequently, there will be a very heavy ratio in favour of pro-war comments. But sometimes it goes the other way. This one was weird because I've never seen one with such a massive disparity between them. Maybe the site was brigaded somehow but since mostly boomers are the only ones who comment there I'm not really sure. There were a few other pro war comments there that had the same outcome.",wm7la9
"To be fair, when I heard the Ukrainians were losing hundreds per day before the HIMARS came in, it wouldn't surprise me in the slightest if that was near the truth. Stuff like that sometimes happens in war. they might not all be killed, but half  KIA/WIA is certainly possible IMHO",wm7la9
