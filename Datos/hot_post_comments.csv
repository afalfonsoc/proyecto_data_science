"These will be elite

They'll make a dent wherever they go",y26xch
"Well done UK, don’t forget we have been training Ukrainian troops since the 2014 invasion of Crimea, it doesn’t just happen over night, motivation, planning, training, innovation, equipment, logistics it’s all part of the end game, all the things the invaders don’t have!",y26xch
Thank you 🇬🇧 🇬🇧 🇬🇧,y26xch
"Good luck, brave heroes!",y26xch
"Talk about a force multiplier. 10,000 well trained and qualified troops. Worthy of twice that or three times what Russia can field, with their prisoners and alcoholics. 
Slava Ukrani!",y26xch
"10,000 well equipped, highly motivated dedenders of Ukraine. 

What a difference compared to that sad, rag tag, drunk and demoralized group of poorly equipped russian concscipts shipped to belarus in cattle carts.

russian wannabe tzar, go f**k yourself!",y26xch
" The Brits don't fuck around... Was watching some of them put Ukrainians through a  Small fire and Movement Course. 
    They were doing over watch and providing covering fire while some advanced, They were working in pairs when firing ( Always one loading under Cover while partner kept fire up.. 
  Muzzle awareness and safe... Popping the targets... tactical movement with all the gear..
    Pretty Sure they taught Patroling, Basic First Aid, Urban Fighting  how to use Navigation and Comm systems and covered all light weapons from pistols to ATGM.
    They are probably already better than whatever is left of the "" Elite"" Russian Units.",y26xch
Godspeed brothers!,y26xch
Congratulations to the brave defenders of Ukraine,y26xch
Shits about to get even more real for Russia.,y26xch
New offensive incoming.either Kherson or Luhansk.,y26xch

"UK here, we are so honoured and proud to help our Ukrainian brothers and sisters, whether it’s training these brave lads and lasses to help defend their motherland, opening up our homes to Ukrainian families fleeing the conflict to local communities donating money, food, basic medicines and medical care, clothing anything they have spare to give. The UK stand with Ukraine 🇺🇦🤝🇬🇧 edit: accidentally deleted original comment",y26xch
"Russian invaders, get wrecked! Slava Ukraini!",y26xch
New counteroffensive incoming 💪🏼,y26xch
"The UK has arguably the best light infantry in the world, so this training is going to be a huge asset on the battlefield.",y26xch
So thats those newly conspripted alcoholics sorted.,y26xch
More well trained fresh troops to rotate to the front and relieve the units that have been on a tear for the last two months.,y26xch
This makes me very happy to see indeed!,y26xch
"British training is some of the best, they'll be very well trained and 10,000 is a huge force.",y26xch
10.000 badasses,y26xch
Go fuck the ruskies up,y26xch
"10,000 UK trained soldiers vs. 300,000 drunken old men. Slava Ukraini!!!",y26xch
"Correct me if I’m wrong, but I thought UK was training 10,000 total and not waves of 10,000? The more that are trained the better.",y26xch
"And another 10K please

And then another 10K...then another..and another...keep 'em coming",y26xch
Warriors 💪🫡,y26xch
"I might sound ignorant or stupid, but I genuinely thought they were only training officers. Didn’t expect thousands. This is bonkers! May they be safe and liberate the whole country before Christmas!",y26xch
Slava Ukrani! As a Brit I’m proud we help you guys out.,y26xch
"Go get em lads, the training you have been given will serve you and your country well! God speed and give them hell 👊",y26xch
Oh boy. Hold on to your sock (or sock cloth) now ruskies,y26xch
"The UK have the best Military training facilities and instructors on the globe, the best Navy, the best special service and secret service in the world. 

Russia are only threatening with nuclear weapons because they know they are out matched, come on...they haven't exactly done well in Ukraine have they? Well done Ukraine you've stood your ground and we will continue to support and if russia go into any nato territory its over for them. Nuclear weapons will not be authorised as they have to be passed by 15 different officials which all have to say yes, and 9 of them are against this war, putin has no say whatsoever on the use of nuclear weapons.",y26xch
Each of those well-trained troops will be equivalent to at least 20 untrained ruzzian conscripts or volunteers or mercenaries.,y26xch
"When morale is high shit gets done
Goodluck to all involved 
You will be in my thoughts and prayers. 
Now go kick ass and get your home back!",y26xch
Tally ho boys!,y26xch
"These Ukrainian troops have been well trained in all repects of infantry and mechanized battle applications. They will be an effective force against the poorly trained Russians.

Canada has provided 270 military trainers as part of the training effort in the UK to ensure the Ukrainian Armed Forces are successful. The UAF as a result will be robust!

Glory to Ukraine, and may the 'force' be with you!",y26xch
"Alot of people would donate/fund for this 100%.

The livesaving ass kicking skills that will be sorely needed to help survival.",y26xch
"Ex UK forces here, proud of the training they have received. They will best lethal on the battlefield. Gods speed gentlemen. I will buy you all beer in a free Ukraine 🇺🇦 🇬🇧",y26xch
"Reminds me of that scene from clone wars 200,000 Units are ready with a million more well on the way""",y26xch
The UK detests Russia so glad were doing alot to help.,y26xch

Slava Ukraini ✊️ 🇺🇦 ❤️ 🇬🇧",y26xch

British know how plus motivated Ukrainians. Damn!",y26xch

"Best troops in the world 🇬🇧

Godspeed Ukrainian brothers 🇺🇦",y26xch
10k UK/NATO trained Ukrainians vs 300k conscripts... It's just fucking not fair. Those poor ratnik bastards,y26xch
Good hunting!,y26xch
"Slava Ukrain!

🇬🇧🇬🇧🇬🇧🇬🇧🇬🇧🇬🇧",y26xch
"That’s exciting! The NATO level combat skills, high quality weapons, artillery and they are going to smoosh the Russians.",y26xch
Best of luck,y26xch
"The British Army has some of the worlds finest instructors along with some pretty amazing training facilities that were all fine tuned during the Afghan war. That coupled with the instructors from the US, Canada and Denmark etc. will make these troops an absolute nightmare for the Russians. ⚔️ 🇬🇧🇺🇦 🇺🇸🇩🇰⚔️",y26xch
"It cannot be overstated how much more effective well trained regular troops are compared to those who have a week (or less!) of practice before being sent to the front lines. Russian conscripts and Ukrainian volunteers to the territorial defense forces can dig a hole, hold a gun and point it at the enemy, but they simply cannot execute effective offensive operations. You MUST have well trained troops to do combined arms offensives. There is no substitute.

Each tranche of 10k troops returning to Ukraine from the international training program in GB will be a significant increase in Ukraine's offensive military power.",y26xch
"UK taxpayer here.

I’d gladly have my taxes raised a little to directly support more of this.

Kick their assess!",y26xch
"10k highly trained individuals who are armed well vs 300k conscripts,  no training,  and terrible equipment. We know who's going to win this.",y26xch
"This is how you defend your country. It drove me crazy in the amount of military support the allies gave to Afghanistan yet they could not mount their own counter offensive against the Taliban. Bush kept saying, "" When they stand up, we'll stand down "".

 It takes less than  a year in training for most forces so after 20 years plus how could they not stand up?",y26xch
"I wish you all the best. Win this war and come back safe to your families!

Slava ukraini",y26xch
God speed and give em hell!,y26xch
May God bless all warriors from Ukraine,y26xch
Heroes! I hope they'll get through.,y26xch
God speed,y26xch
"The West and Ukraine in unity there is always victory. This could be an alliance and a friendship that has the potential to last for generations. Russia wanted to destroy Ukraine, now it shall be the ones being destroyed...",y26xch
"UK has a very long and proud history of having some of the best-trained infantry in the world. These Ukrainians are de facto among those ranks now.

There are some very worried Russians out there right now 😋",y26xch
"Best of luck boys! Not that they’ll need it but still.

Slava Ukraini",y26xch
The moment I - and many - have been waiting for. Get the next batch ready ASAP.,y26xch
"gentleman, you are about to enter a target rich environment 

feast",y26xch
I hope they can really outsmart and outskill their opponents and take their country back,y26xch
"New Heroes are coming, destroy ruSSian goblins",y26xch
I can see some severe ass kicking coming towards ruskies.,y26xch
Just curious- how long did they train? And are there other groups in the pipeline so that soldiers are being constantly trained?,y26xch
"Had the opportunity to meet a few, fucking lovely bunch, wish them all the best.",y26xch
Get some.,y26xch
Kick som russian ass 🇺🇦 Slava Ukraini,y26xch
Nice,y26xch
Go kick their ass,y26xch
"They've been pushing back Russians, without even their full forces deployed?!",y26xch
Godspeed.,y26xch
"10,000 well trained, extremely motivated, armed to the neck and geared to the high heavens  soldiers (not even to mention that are fighting for a cause EVERY single one of those would die for in a heartbeat) are a force multiplier like no other… the British have always leaned to having a smaller but much more well trained army and that has clearly worked out as they’re considered some of if not the best infantry in the world.",y26xch
"I wish you all the best! I hope you dont get hurt!

Love from Denmark",y26xch
Godspeed.,y26xch
Oh shit,y26xch
"I'm not from from either places but this made me so proud as a human being, for a moment in time.",y26xch

Kick some orc asses gents!,y26xch

"10 000?
Some Russians are about to bleed.",y26xch
This has to make Vlad Mad.,y26xch
Complete with Berets. Hell yeahhh!!!,y26xch
"Member the ten thousand Roman’s in 60ad ? Yeah these are the ukranian resurrection of them. 10k gods, against tampon wielding 300k strong orc vadims. 

Good luck tampon vertebrae’s , can’t wait for your shit to snap.",y26xch
"Take it to ‘em guys.

🫡 Go and slaughter those Russians,y26xch

"That's 10000 clued up , pissed off motherfuckers right there....🇺🇦💪🇺🇦💪🇺🇦🇺🇦",y26xch
 Will the offensive heat up again when they're deployed?,y26xch
"I had no idea this was even a thing here in the UK. Unbelievable commitment to the cause from us, hope they all do their country proud and make their home safe for their families to return",y26xch
UKraine,y26xch
Do these soldiers stay in together as a unit or do they make up the NCO's and Officers of many units?,y26xch
GODSPEED! STAY SAFE AND GIVE THE ORCS HELL! 🇺🇦 🇬🇧,y26xch
Give em hell!,y26xch
Night and day between them and what I've seen coming out of Russia to oppose them...,y26xch
Russian conscripts:  You guys are getting training?,y26xch
"More importantly... they're being allowed to go home **with full kit**. 

I'm not sure, but I think that might also mean their weapon as well, since they signed for it.",y26xch

"UK citizen here, usually I'm embarrassed to say that after the last few years, brexit and the politely and economic situation that just goes from bad to worse. But, this story? Yeah, makes me proud to be British.",y26xch
Trained by the best army in the world!,y26xch
Any insights/links regarding how much/what kind of training these guys are given? Hadn't realised it was that big a of a volume we'd taken on.,y26xch
This training gives them the very best fighting chance against the conscriptovitchs,y26xch
How long is their training in the UK? Are they trained by UK military or Ukraine’s?,y26xch
They need to send a bunch of Ukrainian troops to get seal training. After that they won’t have to worry about the “special forces” of Russia lol,y26xch
8 am positive that the Russian military must be super jealous of the Ukraine forces.,y26xch
God Save the King! And God save Ukraine! 🇬🇧🇺🇦,y26xch
I wonder if this includes competent officers that aren't corrupt af and know what mission briefings and intelligence reports are....,y26xch
"The UK has lots of criticism leveled at her for various things, including foreign policy

But this right here, sharing ops knowledge and how to transform your infantry from direct order based structures, to self organising teams is something that I think quite literally changes the playing field such that the table is almost flipped over to a Ukraine advantage. 

the UK have reportedly mastered the mix of knowledge and capability in small teams such that when the going gets tough - they know what to do and execute professionally without the need for checks and balances from leadership. 

Guess what system Russia still use? As I understand it; dumb grunt only obey order from on-high methodology. Do not step outside your area of influence - so for a grunt, your shoes and your trigger finger. This means when things get hot and Ukraine is jamming your AM radios - you don't know what to do.

In contrast, Ukraines teams will know what to do out of instinct with self organising, self led, teams and units. The overarching outcome is agreed, and professionals decide how each move on the chess board goes. Obviously there are times for direct rule, and times for self organising. 

to train Ukraine on self leading teams, even just some of it, is a completely priceless, timeless gift. It would have required alot of trust. 

Well done UK, and well done UK taxpayers for supporting this. Its above and beyond, really - and no less than Ukraine need or deserve.",y26xch

Basically watching a Holocaust from Canada. I hate myself for being powerless but growing up reading the books about ww2 and same thing. I imagined being a hero. We are worse than pieces of shit watching this from across the ocean. People getting anihilated by second hitler or Stalin and his ruzzian n..zz..ies. Oh YouTube does not like that word. God for it we insult Russians even though they are murdering and butchering. Freaking Bloodlands. The history just repeats and everyone just turns the blind eye. So disgusting.

And the Russians won't not be able to help themselves but to imagine the cruelty their brothers endured at our hands, and our boot heels, and the edge of our knives. And the Russians will be sickened by us, and the Russians will talk about us, and the Russians will fear us. And when the Russians closes their eyes at night and they're tortured by their subconscious for the evil they have done, it will be with thoughts of us they are tortured with.",y26xch

"So many musk lovers…. He is being a spoilt little brat and so throwing his teddy out the cot.
He needs to grow up and stop being a child.
He has respect for his achievements and should stop being childish.",y3ewx1
Elon Musk needs Aluminum and other resources from Russia.,y3ewx1
"Dear Elon 

Go fuck yourself, you little prick.

Sincerely yours - Me",y3ewx1
Musk is such a temperamental and petty bitch.,y3ewx1
"Ah, but you were in a position to accept billions of US Dollars in subsidies, tax cuts and contracts. Fucking tool.",y3ewx1
"I bet that tab includes profit margins. Nah, screw this guy. This is why global satellite internet should be a multi-national resource. NATO should make their own and cut this guy out. He is a single-point-of-failure and his risk of failure grows daily.",y3ewx1
As the guy bathes in US GOV subsidies…never bite the hand that feeds you!,y3ewx1
"If he misplays his cards, the American government might nationalize his network and commandeer it in the name of national security. Stranger things have happened.",y3ewx1
"So much for the introductory free trial.  Elon probalby needs some cash.  The New Glen just got grounded, they are making him actually buy Twitter, and someone's probably pregnant.",y3ewx1
Is that what Putin told him to do on his phone call?,y3ewx1
"So this was his plan all along. Give away expensive systems, seem like the good guy, and then hook them on a subscription fee. What an evil scheme.",y3ewx1
"I can no longer afford to hope to buy a tesla, i will now hope to buy a different overpriced electric vehicle.",y3ewx1
It’s already been financed by the US government this whole time...,y3ewx1
"He volunteered Starlink  to help Ukraine and then decided to bend the knee to Putin. Now he's going to withdraw Starlink unless the United States government whose foreign policy he was busy undermining, pays him. Chutzpah",y3ewx1
"The government has a lot of leverage with musk.  They grant licenses and contracts for most SpaceX operations, they get involved in settling disputes from other low orbit sat operators, they decided how much tax incentives are given for solar, batteries, EVs etc.  The government could make the cost of Ukraine seem like a drop in the bucket.",y3ewx1
"So much for Elon ""The Con"" Musk's generosity. Seriously, fuck this guy! He's an opportunist who wanted to swing both sides. I bet Putler offered him a sweet deal to make those tweets and try to influence the West. Now he wants the government to provide the service after leeching them off of money from the Starlink servers that were supposedly ""donated"" by him? Fuck this guy, really! He can go suck Putler's dick!",y3ewx1
Question for anyone. Is Musk trying to sabotage the Ukrainians? Or possibly extorting US Gov for not giving his starlink rural broadband subsidies? Or both?,y3ewx1
Uhh....haven't we already been paying for this? Right? Pentagon's been paying this. Now this dweeby-ass dweeb is saying he can't afford to keep doing something  that he wasn't paying for to begin with?,y3ewx1
"Bullshit, ask one of the richest people in the world, your boss, for some money. Fucking parasites.",y3ewx1
Someone has to pay Amber Heard’s legal bills,y3ewx1
Musk is such a fuckin tool. I can't stand the dude,y3ewx1
"MuZk is pouting like the petulant spoiled greedy egomaniacal child that he is, since most people (except Little Peter and his cabal, n.korea, syria etc), didn't agree with his Little Peter licking, and the fact that he should stick to shilling and pumping/dumping investors and taxpayers, and communing with his twitter groupies.",y3ewx1
Greedy Musk,y3ewx1
"Who saw that coming? I mean really, I hope no one in their right mind thought he was doing something like this without a way out..",y3ewx1
Privatizing profits and socializing losses,y3ewx1
"Because Lex Luthor, i mean Elon Musk, is is a tit.",y3ewx1
"Why is he getting so much hate? He is beholden to shareholders, even if spacex isn't public. Giving away free shit decreases profit, shareholders don't like that. Businesses exist to make money.",y3ewx1
"Elon Musk is the Tulsi Gabbard of billionaires.

He’s a fucking idiot is what I’m trying to say.",y3ewx1
Qwitter,y3ewx1
I wanna see Elon same fate as dugma,y3ewx1
what a fucking douche canoe,y3ewx1
"Pay him the money

But pls scrub their tax and subsidies throughoutly 

USA should come out it it in a richer position",y3ewx1
[removed],y3ewx1
"Let's pull Musk out of the equation. SpaceX is a business that is putting a lot of its money into launching rockets into space and developing further space exploration programs. All of these are insanely expensive. Not to mention the 12,000 hard working employees that depend on a profitable or at least close to even that they have been operating at (last I read they had a 0.2% profit margin, that was before Russia invaded Ukraine). Put that up against anyone of these other defense contractors that operate around the 10% profit margin that are not donating shit, but making cash hand over fist. I think the good people at SpaceX have done an incredible job and thanks for their immeasurable contributions to enabling Ukrainian mission command!

Now you can proceed talk shit about the talking heads at the top all you want.",y3ewx1
Then just pay for them. No string attached anymore,y3ewx1
"Dang, I didn’t know SpaceX was paying it alone, how much money have they spent so far on satélites? Id assume it’s a lot of money",y3ewx1
comments in here filled with soy,y3ewx1
One step closer to Dr Eviltown,y3ewx1
Seize his assets in the US.,y3ewx1
"Dear Elon, I would be ashamed!
Are you acting as Putins puppet? Or are you just afraid of accidently falling out a window?
You are one of the richest persons living on earth. You should know what to do! Shame on you.",y3ewx1
I'm happy to boycott all Musk products due to this.,y3ewx1

"The StratCom of the Armed Forces of Ukraine reports that the Russian military themselves hit Belgorod, Russia in an attempt to shell Kharkov, Ukraine.

""An hour ago, the Russian decided to bombard Kharkov! But all 3 missiles self-destructed during launch, and one flew into a residential building in Belgorod, Russia. S-300 operator, many thanks from the Armed Forces of Ukraine.""",y2uxlw
"They must have found a nazi in that building isn't it ? Or maybe another faulty missile that didnt want to enter Ukraine ?  Ahahha. Who knows....

still, I wouldnt live in that city of Belgorod, not because i would be affraid of Ukrainians but most of it because i am pretty sure Russia is shooting itslef to Say ""look they attack us"". It is not the current objective of ukraine that have much more important stuff to destroy on its OWN territory... And godspeed to them 💪💪💪",y2uxlw
"How tf do you miss ukraine. The second biggest country in Europe. Like, how tf do you miss a country",y2uxlw

"Makes me wonder how reliable their nuclear missiles are.

Nuclear missiles require a lot of maintenance. The US Air Force has thousands of missile maintainers whose only job is make sure the missiles are able to get to where they are supposed to.

A nuclear missile is a very complex piece of machinery. If their missile command is as corrupt as the rest of the force it's going to be a crapshoot with their nukes.",y2uxlw

Russian ""bombit"" is not ""bombing"". It usually means shelling (but includes bombing).

If they had the support system needed for it and trained crews….maybe,y2v7k1
"Depends on how they are deployed in conjunction with other assets on the battlefield. What you have to look at is how these differ capability wise from other tanks and their capabilities on the battlefield. Tanks alone are pretty useless but combine them with infantry, IFV's, artillery, air assets, good ISR and good command and control, they can be extremely effective.",y2v7k1
"No. The logistical footprint of these things is absolutely huge. According to General Petraeus the idea of sending M1 Abrams to Ukraine is completely impractical. The engine for example is basically a jet engine in terms of its maintenance and skills needed for upkeep, you just can’t do it without staff with years of experience.",y2v7k1
F-16s would make more of a difference,y2v7k1
"I think modernized Ukrainian T-80s , T-72s, maybe T-64BVs with well trained crew (trained for years to use these tanks) are much more effective than M1A1 with poorly trained crew.

 Of course Abrams tanks are much more effective and powerful. They are game changer. But they require much more logistics as well as spare parts. It's problem to find them. Ukrainians can use parts from disabled, partially destroyed russian tanks to repair their tanks. As I said. Everyone can shoot target with M4. But not everyone can fight with it like Navy seal.

Alternatively, NATO countries can take some Ukrainian servicemen to train them for Abrams. It will take months. I'm not sure they already started it or not. Maybe it's time to begin.",y2v7k1
 Better off Getting T-72s from Eastern Europe and other Countries... Ukrainians are well Schooled on them and have logistics in place.,y2v7k1
Forget it. They need tomahawks.,y2v7k1
Not really - Abrams uses jet engine so fuel would be a problem - they’re also MUCH bigger and heavier than T-72/T80 so would struggle with terrain?,y2v7k1
"No, because they're to heavy for Ukrainian mud. During winter when the ground is frozen, however, would be a good time for them to get into the fight.",y2v7k1
"Tbh id go light faster armoured units with hull mounted javalins and a 50. You can deal with anything and get the shit out of there when it gets to heavy.

I love tanks but there times coming to an end as there just to many ways to blow them up and they cost a shit tone of money",y2v7k1
"No; the logistical burden of this tank is MASSIVE. Where other tanks use reliable and fuel economy minded Diesel engines that get good fuel economy, this tank uses a FUCKING AVIATION JET ENGINE.

This means that the Abrams is able to use a wide variety of fuel, but also means you’ll need it to because you’ll be pilfering anything you can to pour into this thirsty beast. It generates awesome acceleration at low speeds compared to traditional Diesel engines, but requires you to essentially have a massive aviation-grade maintenance program for the power pack. 

This is possibly the most difficult tank to provide maintenance and resupply for that is currently fielded in the world. The US Army is uniquely equipped to provide this support, but probably ONLY the US Army could ever hope to be able to do so. It needs so much fuel so often that you’re either constrained to large road networks every 150km for refuel, or you use a massive cargo lift capacity (which Ukraine does not have) in order to fly all the fuel you need in, which is hilariously inefficient.

The Abrams is the German Zweihander of tanks; huge, unwieldy and for most people impractical to use. In the hands of a giant man, appropriate and massively deadly. But very few have hands large enough (logistical capacity) to wield such a large weapon effectively.",y2v7k1
 I hear they’re getting latest ones from ruZZia soon enough.,y2v7k1
"Probably, but not certainly. I watched an American General say that the problem with the M1A1 and other editions is that it requires a very advanced group of support people to support it logistically. If the Ukraine has that then yes, if not then no.",y2v7k1
"If Russian tanks are having issues due to their weight, the Abrams won't stand a chance on anything less than a highway",y2v7k1
No a leopard is a better choice for Ukraine with its diesel and quick engine swap system Ukrainians are well versed in working on diesels. Also need troop support and air coverage to be successful with tank’s. What the Ukrainians are doing with guerrilla tactics and moving in fast with wheeled vehicles is the best option for them right now pretty much kinda of like a modern blitzkrieg in a way.,y2v7k1
"Probably not. These things run on gas turbines and require a heavy logistics train and very specialized support personnel. Also, they suck down the fuel.  Diesel tanks are far more appropriate. Things like Leopard 2s, Le Clercs, Merkavas etc.",y2v7k1
Nah interoperability would be a issue thats y the west keeps asking the former soviet bloc countries to give soviet made weapons(in exchange for western stuffs) to ukraine so it will be put to work immediately with little to 0 need of training,y2v7k1
With the mechanics and proper logistics yes. M1’s are a turbine engine and take jet fuel essentially. The T models run on diesel. Very different resupply logistics are needed. I agree with the overall sentiment though,y2v7k1
"I don’t think so. 

I once heard a story about how the king of Siam would gift elephants to people he didn’t like because he knew it would be a nightmare to maintain and feed thus driving them into poverty and despair in the long term. 

An Abrahams would be that elephant for the Ukrainians. 

Give them everything else *except* this goddamn logistical nightmare",y2v7k1
Too Bad my government wont let those leopards out of their cages. Im Sure theyd love to hunt smth down by their own.,y2v7k1
Only one way to find out,y2v7k1
"Subject has been discussed to death, read previous posts and find something new.",y2v7k1
"Probably is dependent on the quality of training the crews and maintenance teams can get. Ukrainians are much more familiar with legacy ussr kit, Abrams is an entirely different beast. Hopefully there's already a secret project going somewhere that's been training dudes up, would be absolutely hilarious if a division of Abrams just showed up to the fronts.",y2v7k1
"No, because Abrams would suck for Ukrainian logistics.",y2v7k1
"Probably not, they’re incredibly fuel intensive and without the reactive armour packages are very vulnerable especially given their comparative size to the T series of tanks. Plus the added logistics train for yet another type of vehicle would probably cause more headaches and hinderance than help",y2v7k1
"It's just not a smart comment.... how long does a American tank operator take to learn all about the Abrahams???? You can't just give them equipment and use It accordingly... all instructions are in english and I know for sure the harden tanks operators in ukrain aren't fluent in english... they are beeing sent to Poland for 4 reasons... they aren't in direct war with Russia, they are sending their surplus war equipment to ukrain, and they belong to NATO, the tanks are up to date, they are old from the Afghanistan/Iraq wars.....",y2v7k1
They need A-10s,y2v7k1
"Is that an Abrahms? Don't they run on jet feul? It seems that there would have to be major changes in training just for maintrnance, secure enough frul for a fleet, plus they are supposed to be much heavier, so running on fields would be limited to frozen ground or hard packed earth. It doesn't sound like an easy go.",y2v7k1
Maybe a town or two but no major cities ...  It I really don't know,y2v7k1
"Doubtful. Military History Visualized did a good breakdown video about why the Leopard 2 isn’t a great choice for Ukraine, one of the big reasons being that a lot of Eastern European bridges aren’t necessarily strong enough for the extra weight of the Leopard compared to the T-72 and other Soviet designs. The Abrams is about 10 tons heavier than the Leopard 2, and the Leopard 2 has about 10 tons on the T-72.",y2v7k1
Does the Pope shit in the woods?,y2v7k1
"At the end of the day, like the chieftain says, no matter how modern your tank is, the one that shoots first always wins",y2v7k1
"No it’s just a tank, an incredibly expensive and complicated tank…",y2v7k1
send the modernized M60s first. i guess it's easier to train for than an abrams??,y2v7k1
I would say if the smaller lighter T series of Russia is getting stuck everywhere in the marshes of Ukraine the Abrams would be even worse due to its size and weight. Whole reason why Russia made smaller lighter tanks for their areas. But I could be wrong I am no expert.,y2v7k1
"I used to think ""yes"" but field support and bridges to support the weight . A lighter tank ? What is your opinion?",y2v7k1
"Yeah, but Ukraine wouldn’t had capture as many usable Russian tanks and BMPs",y2v7k1
Egypt has 1200 Abraham’s tanks and their own tank factory to make Abraham’s. We should buy some from them. And ship them through the Bosporus.,y2v7k1
Maybe no one would notice a few brigades of US tankers in Abrams and some flyboys in Warthogs?,y2v7k1
Yes,y2v7k1
maybe if they had a few squadrons of A10S,y2v7k1
"Ok folks, I get that everyone has stated that the powerpack of this tank is a logistical nightmare...but (and you're all going to have to forgive me for the stupid questions) why can't the US just go to companies like Caterpillar or Cummins and request a new powerpack be made for this tank? Its not like Caterpillar and Cummins don't have experience with providing powerpacks to military vehicles? I mean didn't the Abrams have a diesel engine at one point?",y2v7k1
maybe in 5 years.... but there is a lot of infrastructure to maintain a tank,y2v7k1
It would be better to send a truck load of mini guns and a couple of spooky hercs it’s going to be pretty target rich soon when the conscripts arrive..,y2v7k1
One shot one kill while moving,y2v7k1
Is that a Challenger II?,y2v7k1
"Probably better off with a challenger 2 as it's powered by a 4 stroke diesel engine and has among the best armour of any tank, not to mention a rifled gun for better accuracy",y2v7k1
I think some predators would do more good than these.,y2v7k1
"If Ukraine had MORE of the same stuff they get today, we'd see Ruzzians further back indeed.

I've listed to what Ukrainian military are saying and it is heart breaking. Even shit like BMP1 is super valued.

#Compare deliveries to Ukraine to what Afghan army was getting. 

E.g. MRAPs. 4k (!!!) were delivered to Afghans, UKR was promised to get 200 soon.",y2v7k1
I don't understand why the US don't ship those the m1 abrahams is damm superior the Russians will crap their pants and abandon their own tanks without hesitation.,y2v7k1
"Ukraine has the best tank defense in the world now and tanks are mostly obsolete. Ukraine needs counter-battery and air-defense, not tanks. The issue is Russian artillery.",y2v7k1
"The support and training required (not just for crews but for mechanics and other specialists) would mean pulling thousands of soldiers off the front for about 3-6 months, not feasible in the middle of a conflict",y2v7k1
"Yes, for sure, but they don’t get it, it’s to hightech.",y2v7k1
They’re excellent defensively and would be wiser to have them defended the Belarus border at first till numbers and maintenance swells up,y2v7k1
"No. Ukraine does exceedingly well using the military materiel they currently possess.

Guided rockets, longbows, cruise missiles and air support is what I assume they would be able to supplement their current arsenal with, without loss of effectiveness.",y2v7k1
"Would it help tank vs tank? Sure. But that’s not the reality of the war. Artillery and air defense is what UA needs. Air defense to keep shooting down the most expensive wep system ru has and artillery’s to keep Destroying supplies and ammo dumps. Also, artillery would be better at keeping command posts moving which cost operation planning creating more disorganization and chaos for the orcs.",y2v7k1
"Maybe. Tanks are on their way to obsolescence. We can see that in how many tank kills Ukrainians have been scoring with fire-and-forget smart weaponry, like the Javelin.

On the other hand, Russians don’t possess many of those shoulder-mounted systems, and their ATGM platforms don’t seem very reliable.",y2v7k1
"This is not a very good weapon system for them.

It requires a highly trained crew to be effective.

It requires daily maintenance and a whole support system of spare parts and vehicles to carry them. This means it also needs a squad of trained technicians.

It needs a tank transporter to move around.

They are too heavy for most bridges.

It is very expensive.

It includes proprietary technology that the U.S. does not want shared or reverse engineered in the case Russia captured one.

Far better to supply N number of advanced anti-tank or anti-air platforms for the same cost, which can be used and tranported easily by infantry with only a small training time to be effectively used. The return on investment is then far greater.

Also, between the aforementioned anti-tank systems, drones, precision artillery, mines, and so on, tanks are looking pretty obsolete on the modern battlefield. They're more like deathtraps than a critical weapons system now. Having them dispersed for various purposes could be useful but armored columns are a thing of the past. Russian armor drives being decisively defeated by like 30 IT guys with drones shows that tanks are not what they used to be.",y2v7k1
Aren't Abrams' basically indestructible?,y2v7k1
"Maybe.

Abrams is extremely heavy, I think only the Israeli Merkava outweighs it for modern main battle tanks. That eight severely limits it's ability to cross rivers using existing bridges. The US has an obscene number of engineer units focused solely on bridging rivers, I do not know if Ukraine has enough bridge laying capacity to make best use of the Abrams on the battlefield.

The Abrams is also an infamous gas guzzler.

Using the Abrams represents not just a major restructuring of Ukrainian armor units, but of their logistics corps and engineers.

I do think that the servility of the German political leadership and scant numbers of British Challenger 2's still make the Abrams the best option over all for Ukraine. There are enough of them that exist today in storage, and the US is likely not figuring out whether or not to give them over, but rather, what else we need to send along with the tanks (bridge layers, fuel trucks, M88 heavy recovery vehicles, etc).

This is not as simple as the HIMARS; this represents a massive structural shift in the Ukrainian Army. The question isn't whether it should happen, it is how do we do this?",y2v7k1
I think just an Abrahms plt would do,y2v7k1
We will never know.,y2v7k1
"I think many arm chair generals will say no for a bunch a good reasons - on paper. Even former tankers may say no, won’t make a difference. Fuel, weight, maintenance, blah blah. All true. 

But all of us also predicted the second best Army in the world would roll over Ukraine in :-14 days. 

Bu here we are months later. We all underestimated Ukraine moral, NATO training, Russian skill and equipment. 

I believe we should give the Ukrainians what they need to get this done. The quicker it’s done, the fewer women and children die and less destruction. 

If we train rose brave men and women and give them are truly best stuff, well, it WOULD make a big difference.",y2v7k1
Wow. Peak shit post material right there. Literal low res photo of a tank and shit post title.,y2v7k1
yes,y2v7k1
"Nah.. a squadron of A-10'S, 2 or 3 F-22s and a couple of Growler's would be more than enough",y2v7k1

"Absolutely unbelievable. I know we’re seeing these updates every day - and we shouldn’t be surprised at this point. But the brutality is just so hard to fathom. Like the recent posts showing the mass graves and the man being walked to certain death before rolling into the hole.  We’re seeing what was experienced during WWII. We couldn’t understand how a military could be made to do those things “back then”. Now, in the modern age where “this is not the era of war”, we’re seeing how easily these soldiers have been pushed to kill their not so distant relatives and countrymen. It wasn’t that long ago that they were all from the same country. Now because of boundaries we can’t see, they try to wipe them from existence. Everyone in the world should see these videos; should be forced to watch them.

I'm 100% sure that he never had thinked about doing Diplomacy with Ukraine. The Richest man in the world, who had everything at his disposal to make great deals with Ukraine simply got drained by his fellows politician over a megalomaniac sentiment of the past. Vladimir Putin is unfortunately a tragedy for Russia and a tragedy for himself. I could even give him pardon if he removed his troops from Ukraine, admitted that he made huge mistakes, but, he, along with so many men of their age & thinking will always refuse to change and it is exactly this personality trait that will bring he and his empire to it's end. Refusal to change as a person in this life will only lead you to your disgrace, because these are the rules played by nature, you can't go against the laws of nature and unfortunately for him, this is exactly what he is doing.

"As a US military veteran, this baffles me. One of the core things we are taught is to not leave weapons for the enemy. If we have to retreat, we are trained to destroy weapons and ammo as we go, so as to not let them fall into enemy hands. 

A high profile example is the helicopter that crashed during the Bin Laden raid. SEALS used explosives to destroy the aircraft before extraction in order to deny intel and technology to the enemy. 

Are the Russians so poorly trained as to not understand a basic principle of war? When artillery batteries were overrun, back in the day, they would ""spike"" the guns; rendering them useless to the enemy. Why are the Russians not destroying equipment and ammunition that they can't take with them when they retreat? This is not high level military strategy. This is super basic.",y2r5it

The whole Russian federation could be destroyed in Ukraine. We're witnessing the death of an empire,y2u6je
"The statement of State Duma deputy Mikhail Sheremet that it is time for the Ukrainian army to take power in the country into its own hands testifies only to the uncertainty of the Russian authorities in the victory over Ukraine. These are the next words of despair. In connection with the autumn active offensive actions of the Armed Forces of Ukraine in the eastern and southern regions, the Russian military leadership understands that it cannot keep illegally ""connected"" on the eve of the territory of the so-called ""LDPR"", Zaporozhye and Kherson regions. To date, the military logistics of the Russian army has actually been completely depleted.

Feeling so defeated, the Russian leadership decided to take a blatant step with mass rocket attacks on the civilian population (23 people were killed, more than 100 injured) and critical infrastructure facilities in many cities of Ukraine. It is trying its best to persuade Kiev and Western countries to sit down with them at the negotiating table.

In just two days on October 10 and 11, the Russian Federation fired more than 100 high-precision missiles on the territory of Ukraine. At this rate, Russia will soon run out of high-precision weapons, which it will not be able to replenish due to Western sanctions.

After Russia's massive missile strikes on the civilian population and critical infrastructure of Ukraine, the Ukrainian army will destroy the Russian army with even greater inspiration. At the same time, she will not take revenge on Russian civilians, and even try to invade the territory of the Russian Federation recognized by the world community. The Russian armed forces are not ""attached to the wall"" in Ukraine. They will be safe if they go back to Russia.

A serious problem for the Russian army is also the very weak morale of its soldiers. More than half a million men fled the country to avoid mobilization. With the course of the war and the death of a large number of Russian soldiers, fewer and fewer Russian citizens will want to fight in a war they do not understand.

Russian elites understand that the successes of the Armed Forces of Ukraine on the battlefield are rapidly approaching the defeat of the Russian Federation and personally of President Vladimir Putin. The more obvious the defeat of the Russian army becomes, the more people in Putin's entourage will increasingly argue whether they want to be in ""one sled"" with him. The Russian defeat in Ukraine will imperceptibly develop into a struggle for power in the Kremlin.

If the struggle for power begins, all Russians will have other concerns except Ukraine, and the war will give way to much more important problems within Russian society. Soon Russia can be seen as a completely different country.",y2u6je
Russia is fucked-up enough to start dropping nukes before they accept defeat.,y2u6je
Or Russia's army could be the last to defeat Putin's army: his police force.,y2u6je

"There you go guys.

When Vladimir Putin launched missile strikes targeting Ukrainian cities and critical infrastructure this week, the move seemed to earn the Russian president a reprieve from hard-liners who had been demanding more decisive action.

“Run, Zelensky, run,” cheered Ramzan Kadyrov, the Chechen leader who has sent militias into Ukraine to fight in the war, referring to the Ukrainian president. Kadyrov declared himself to be “100 percent happy” with the conduct of the war after weeks of lambasting Russia’s military leadership over recent disastrous retreats.

But some senior Russian officials and people within the business elite are drained and depressed — and the expectation is of a worsening political and economic climate. If Putin’s military escalation was partly aimed at putting the lid on turmoil bubbling up over the war’s mismanagement, then its impact may only be temporary, several officials and business executives said in interviews.

“On the battlefield there are other problems,” said an influential Moscow businessman who, like others interviewed for this report, spoke on the condition of anonymity because of personal security fears. “I don’t think it will lift the pressure,” referring to the missile strikes.

In addition, the business executives and officials said, even if the strikes succeed in damaging more of Ukraine’s electricity and energy networks with the fighting dragging on into the freezing winter, there are questions over how many missiles Russia has left and how long it can sustain a bombing campaign. The missiles “are being produced. But in single units. And the old reserves are running out,” one state official said.

Russia’s new commander in Ukraine was decorated after brutality in Syria.

Ever since the Ukrainian army began recapturing swaths of territory in Ukraine’s south and east, Putin has been scrambling, forced to send hundreds of thousands of barely trained reservists to try to fortify Russia’s exhausted army — a move that sparked protests across Russia and sent at least 300,000 Russian men fleeing across the country’s borders to avoid the draft.

As signs of discord within Putin’s inner circle began to surface, Saturday’s humiliating attack on the Kremlin’s prized Kerch Bridge to Crimea seemed the final straw.

“No one is happy with the status quo,” the Russian state official said. “It is clear that a military or political victory will not be possible. But a loss is not possible either. This is turning into the situation in chess known as zugzwang, when each step is worse than the next and yet it is impossible not to move.”

The optimism of the summer when, according to a second state official, many in the country’s elite believed “we’ll turn everything around and find a way” has completely evaporated. “People see there is no future,” he said.

The forced mobilization has already dealt a blow to Putin’s popularity, one of the main bases for his legitimacy as president, and when the dead bodies of reservists begin to return from the front, the situation could worsen, the Moscow businessman said.

“In several months, there will be a very negative dynamic in Russia: a worsening of the mood in society,” he said. “Everything depends on the front.”

“Putin’s arsenal of possible action is very limited,” said Sergei Aleksashenko, a former deputy governor of the Russian Central Bank who is now living in exile in the United States. “Apart from striking civilian infrastructure, he only has the option of using a tactical nuclear weapon. If the Ukrainian counterattack continues, the question of what to do further remains in front of Putin.”

Russia’s annexation puts world ‘two or three steps away’ from nuclear war.

But few in Moscow say Putin will resort to deploying a tactical nuclear strike, despite the Kremlin’s statements, the Moscow businessman said, because “then he won’t have any cards left,” while China could block that kind of escalation. “This is a Pandora’s box \[the Chinese\] don’t want opened,” he said.

Saudi Arabia’s support for oil production cuts this winter seemed to have emboldened the Russian president, said the same Moscow executive, who maintains contacts with political officials. Even if energy prices remain at the same level, Putin “thinks Europe will be in crisis and will have no time for Ukraine.”

“This is still a war of attrition, until one side is not able to continue the war,” he said.

Gazprom’s chief executive, Alexei Miller, on Wednesday warned “entire cities” in Europe could freeze and said there were no guarantees Europe could survive the winter with the current levels of gas reserves.

Economists and business executives say sanctions are beginning to hit the Russian economy harder, with budget cuts already being imposed — while a proposed price cap to be levied by the Group of Seven nations on Russian oil sales from December would be a further blow. The Russian president “will run low on cash … He needs cash to pay Iran and North Korea for weapons. But we will see in December a completely new reality,” said Sergei Guriev, the provost at the Sciences Po university in Paris.

Amid expectations of more and tougher sanctions, every piece of bad news from the front line is a new blow for the Russian economy, a second member of the Moscow business elite said.

“All of business is suffering from what’s happening. Everyone has frozen their investment plans,” he said. The previous belief that Russia could redirect trade flows away from the West through China, Kazakhstan and India is fast melting away, two of the business executives said. Kazakhstan has begun to block cargoes carrying European goods into Russia, while the Chinese were beginning to stop certain supplies, too.

“Everyone is completely frustrated. The mood is very bad,” a third senior Russian businessman said.

Members of Moscow’s elite are beginning to speak about potential leadership change in a way they have never done before in more than 20 years of Putin’s rule — though no one can say how or when this might happen.

“We have begun entering a revolutionary situation,” the first state official said. “Everyone is waiting for something other than what is happening now: a different leadership, a different war. The hawks want tougher action. The doves want no war at all. The time for a change of the political system is ripening. But how it will happen, I don’t know.”",y2vaax

"Shock and whiplash stress back down the span from the explosion, i imagine. And a weak, poorly fastened seam, maybe? This is russian construction, after all. And it was very rushed when built.",y2qijk
"Stress from the other section falling.  It was either tensile stress, or a vibration that caused a break.",y2qijk
Someone else posted a great link in another chat about this.  The sections are supported by a steel bar that covers multiple sections.  When that bar broke it was no longer balanced weight wise which caused the section on the far right to also break.  The middle section was lucky to not also fall.,y2qijk
Found a manufacturer's site documenting some parts used to hold these bridge sections on the pylons.  [https://hirun.eu/portfolio/kerch-strait-bridge/](https://hirun.eu/portfolio/kerch-strait-bridge/),y2qijk
"Judging by the size and location of the explosion, and the ensuing fire, it's no wonder there's expansive damage.. Probably plenty more damage if you can see it up close. The whole span is compromised...",y2qijk
"Each bridge section spans two pillar gaps, resting on a pillar at either end and with another pillar in the middle of it.  The explosion was at the middle point of the three busted spots.  This broke in half and collapsed into the water, pulling the rest of that section (L) off its pillar and the adjacent section on the other side (R) off.  If you look closely the rightmost part is just being pulled inward toward the destroyed part, the same as the leftmost spot.  But the leftmost spot was pulled farther so went all the way into the water.",y2qijk
Someone finally started looking into the Kerch bridge today…,y2qijk
A NAFO fella went and placed a [REDACTED] on the bottom of the bridge using military dolphins.,y2qijk
It was already like that when I got here...,y2qijk
"It's all connected.  If you tug hard enough in one place to drop two spans into the water, somethings got to give in another (weaker) spot.",y2qijk
"There are sectional units of road deck. They are as long as 2 gaps between pylons; the center rests on one, and the ends rest on 2 others (shared with the next deck section).  When the blast hit, the deck section was cut at the 1/4 mark (left side in picture), the section shifted a bit causing the other end to slip off the pylon, then the whole thing bent in the middle over the center support pylon.  The far right end just got pulled as the left section moved, so the end fell off the bearings too.  Its mostly steel, with thin asphalt on top. steel bends and there is a lot bent on this bridge now.   \[edit, forgot to add about the next section moving\]",y2qijk
"Simpel, Russian quality.",y2qijk
"Hear yee Hear Yee!

I hereby declare Kerch Bridge be renamed to Kaput Bridge, blyyyat.",y2qijk
"Contrary to most people’s beliefs, this type of damage is not typical of a truck bomb; there must have been an air burst that exploded a few feet above the surface of the road; this burst pushed the bridge down fracturing it on both sides of the support pylon. That’s why there are no puck marks or debris from an exploding truck: the explosion was very blunt; a truck bomb would have made a hole on the road and would have shredded the truck and all structures around it.",y2qijk
A sudden change in weight distribution I’d imagine,y2qijk
"The piece of section fallen in is pulling toward the break, causing the sections farther back to move inward toward the break.  At the closest expansion joint, located on a pier, the pulling was not transmitted.  Instead the section was just pulled off of the pier and then collapsed.

Both gravity and the force of the explosion cause the fallen-in section to pull on the road behind it like a suspension bridge cable.  It's not clear when this pull got strong enough or if it was primarily gravity or explosion that did the work.  I'll guess explosion was the biggest force involved since the remaining section is not that large due to how it broke.",y2qijk
Expansion joints would move from the blast and it fortunately fell off its holding plate,y2qijk
"Is that normal traffic on there? Surely not..

Edit: by normal i mean civilian",y2qijk
My C,y2qijk
Shoddy Russian construction?,y2qijk
My guess is the Russians decided to use the section on the far right of the image to fix one of the two damaged sections! Quick thinking! They're a smart bunch!,y2qijk
Physics,y2qijk
People still driving on it. Capitalism is relentless.,y2qijk
A truck bomb.,y2qijk
Is there any rail traffic currently?,y2qijk
"Yup. it wasn't a single explosion, barge is fixing 1 spot, then u have that place with 2 broken, then the burnt rail across...lovely!, now consider this pictures when Vova speaks of ""Nuclear"" weapons....",y2qijk
They are repairing it so they need to remove all the burned or damaged pieces. That's my guess lol,y2qijk
Did you not see the size of the explosion?,y2qijk
Tomahawk cruise missile hit the bridge,y2qijk
"Its not broken, its a shadow.",y2qijk
"In my opinion it was the explosion from below the bridge which push the bridge into air and back. When coming back it broke in section over one of the feet of the bridge. Steel is quite strong but not flexible, therefore with enough stress it will break. For reducing this fact there is steel in the concreete but who knows how much was there and how well it was build. I assume that was not enough to absorb the pressure when coming back.",y2qijk

"Just guys being bros. The Russians tried to unite the various nationalities of the Soviet Union with the concept of Druzhba (Friendship). See e.g. the recently torn down statue of Russian Ukrainian friendship in Kyiv. With all of the deportations, secret policing, political murder, and mass starvation in Ukraine’s particular case, this was at least problematic from the start if not an outright deception.  

Though it is not in any way innocent from its own form of ahistorical imperialism, the United States’s recently budding friendship with former Soviet enemies in Ukraine feels much more genuine and organic - as if the Ukrainians themselves seek self rule on the model of the United States and the West. Perhaps I’m interpreting through my own propagandistic western lens, though, so I would love to be corrected here. If their friendship is not genuine, then Reznikov and Austin are putting on a hell of a performance.",y2d4h1

I trained with one in Boot Camp as a member of Drill Team,  and on boot camp leave nearing Deer Season my neighbor hood gunsmith had a pile of them , 25 $ apiece. Wish I had bought a dozen.. mine was a Remington made in 1944.. no sniper scope with it but those were 1000 yard rifles that marksmen qualified with. Sure.. not auto or semi auto.. but a fine, powerful and accurate rifle , 30-06 bullet that could kill at a distance or thru obstacles. I have killed many deer with it over the years. Many friends deer hunt with all those old previously mentioned rifles.

If she truly means that freedom of speech should be restricted because of stupid Russia, I hope she considers further what she is actually arguing for. I think one of the reasons Russia is bad is because of their laws against free speech. For instance, that they couldn’t call the war a war. We want to be better than Russia, don’t we?

Examples are incitement, defamation, fraud, obscenity, child pornography, fighting words, and threats. The United States also has such limits.

Therefore punishing idiots for supporting an evil cause and holding certain beliefs, in turn makes us who we strive not to be, an authoritarian system like Russia, North Korea, Iran, Saudi Arabia, Belarus and many others.

"**Full Transcript Below:**

*More than 50 countries answer Ukraine's request for air defence equipment*

*The pledge from the international community to assist Ukraine by providing it with more weapons follows the most intense missile attack launched by Russia since the invasion started earlier this year.*

*US Defence Secretary Lloyd Austin standing in a suit in front of the US flag.*

*US Secretary of Defence Lloyd J Austin III speaks at a press conference at the end of the Meeting of the Ukraine Defence Contact Group as part of a NATO Council of Defence Ministers at the Alliance headquarters in Brussels, Belgium. Source: EPA / STEPHANIE LECOCQ/EPA*

*More than 50 countries have met to promise more weapons for Ukraine, focusing on its need for air defences after Russia launched its most intense missile strikes since the start of the war.*

*Opening the meeting of the Ukraine Defence Contact Group at the headquarters of NATO in Brussels, US Defence Secretary Lloyd Austin said Russia's huge wave of missile attacks this week had laid bare the ""malice and cruelty"" of its war.*

*Ukraine had shifted the momentum in the conflict since September with ""extraordinary"" gains but would need more help to keep fighting, he said.*

*Ukraine seeks 'air shield' to counter Russian missiles and Iranian drones*

*""These victories belong to Ukraine's brave soldiers. But the Contact Group's security assistance, training and sustainment efforts have been vital,"" Mr Austin said.*

*Russian attacks using more than 100 missiles have killed at least 26 people across Ukraine since Monday, when President Vladimir Putin ordered what he called retaliatory strikes against Ukraine for an explosion on a bridge.*

*Air raid sirens sounded across swaths of Ukraine for a third day on Wednesday and there were reports of some shelling but no sign of a repeat of the intensive countrywide strikes of the previous two days.*

*The missiles have mostly targeted civilian electricity and heating infrastructure while some hit busy roads, parks and tourist sites, including in the centre of Kyiv.*

*NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg said Russia's missile attacks were a sign of weakness.*

*""The reality is that they're not able to make progress on the battlefield. Russia is actually losing on the battlefield,"" Mr Stoltenberg said.*

*Since Monday's attacks, Germany has sent the first of four planned IRIS-T SLM air defence systems while the US said it would speed up the delivery of a promised NASAMS air defence system.*

*EU energy ministers were also meeting in Prague to work out ways to cope with an energy crisis caused by the war.*

*On Wednesday, Polish pipeline operator PERN said it had detected a leak in one pipe in the Druzhba system that carries oil from Russia to Europe although it said the cause was probably an accident.*

*Global attention has been focused on the security of Russian energy pipelines to Europe since the main undersea gas pipelines were damaged by suspected sabotage last month.*

*The US and its European allies have not said who they blame for huge explosions that blew holes in the two Nord Stream 1 pipelines and one of two pipes that make up the new Nord Stream 2 project but have implied they believe it was Russia.*

*Mr Putin said on Wednesday gas could now be delivered through the remaining undamaged Nord Stream 2 pipe but it was up to Europe to allow it.*

*The new pipeline, completed but never opened, has been suspended by Germany since the invasion.*

*Gazprom boss Alexei Miller said fixing the damaged pipes would take more than a year.*

*As his forces have lost ground on the battlefield since September, Mr Putin has escalated the conflict, ordering the call-up of hundreds of thousands of reservists, proclaiming the annexation of occupied Ukrainian territory and repeatedly threatening to use nuclear weapons to protect Russia.*

*US President Joe Biden said on Wednesday he doubted Putin would use a nuclear weapon.*

*Mr Putin is a ""rational actor who has miscalculated significantly,"" Mr Biden said in a CNN interview, saying he believed the Russian president wrongly expected his invading troops to be welcomed.*

*Asked how realistic he believed it would be for Mr Putin to use a tactical nuclear weapon, Mr Biden responded: ""Well, I don't think he will.""*

*NATO's Mr Stoltenberg told reporters in Brussels on Tuesday the military alliance had not noticed any change in Russia's nuclear posture.*",y2k2es
"On Twitter Lloyd said: This is what unity looks like.  
Today, I gathered defense ministers of nearly 50 countries to discuss the latest battlefield developments in Ukraine 🇺🇦, and to work together on how we can continue to support Ukraine today and over the long haul.  
  
This is great news and obviously is and should be welcomed. However I think it is fair to add that it should not take the bombing of innocent civilians and buildings to garner this unity.  
  
Speaking bluntly it would be best if they were more proactive rather than reactive, specifically in relation to air defence.  
  
Still this is positive news and hopefully means what we have seen over the last few days is less likely to happen again.",y2k2es
Send anything and everything that can help Ukraine. Slava Ukraine 🇺🇦,y2k2es
Send it fast. Protect the civilians,y2k2es
Ukraine have been begging for it for months. Sad that it takes even more deaths before the west answers the call...,y2k2es
"Unless each country is gonna man them themselves 50 potentially differing types of air defence with differing components munitions and maintenance isn't gonna do a lot of good.

Instead why didn't 50 countries PAY for two or three types of short and intermediate range air defence?",y2k2es

I'd love to have just one crate of 7.62x39 please.,y2cgs4
"Russian ""Flederation""",y2cgs4
"I hope that is after moving it. Otherwise, the orcs know where to shell next.",y2cgs4
"I would be scared to open one of those , but the orcs aren’t smart enough to booby trap them I guess .",y2cgs4
"WTF can someone tell me how much ammo, tanks, etc, etc does Russia have? These stock pile’s make Lord of War look like a joke!",y2cgs4
"Great catch,  I'm sure all that will be returned with extreme prejudice!   
Slava Ukraini 🇺🇦",y2cgs4
Holy moly...,y2cgs4
I can not understand why the russian army is unable to bomb there own depots. They are fucking unprofessional. Luckily.,y2cgs4
They could sell the ammo crates in the USA. People would love that stuff as a novelty item. Oh look what I did with my apartment with the Russian ammo crate decor.,y2cgs4
"Woww, laminated descriptions on the boxes. So fancy",y2cgs4
that's a fuck ton of ammunition !,y2cgs4
Fundraising idea: Ukraine sells the 7.62x39mm shit by weight to the people of the countries that support them. C’mon….please?,y2cgs4
That bee is like this is Russian laying in field da? Where's sunflower come out at? Little dude trynna skip a step and pollinate the shells that make the fertilizer to grow the sunflowers. What a patriotic little fella.,y2cgs4
"Well, it’s the only thing they are good for. That and becoming fertilizer.",y2cgs4
Look like neatly stacked full boxes.  Not a bunch of empties thrown everywhere - good find for the Ukrainians.,y2cgs4
Literal tons of ammo > Figurative tons of ammo,y2cgs4
Positive feedback loop.,y2cgs4
"With yellowjackets nesting in there, good call... just leave it.",y2cgs4
A goodwill gesture,y2cgs4
Russia.... please send coordinates of your nearest headquarters so Ukraine Army can safely return your lend lease ammunition with the minimum of delay.,y2cgs4
I know of a few good uses...,y2cgs4
Yummy.,y2cgs4
No panic they just wanted to level the playing fields….everything is going as planned lol,y2cgs4
"""lend lease land release"" - What a pun I just made!",y2cgs4
Isn't it getting cold for that bee 🐝🐝. Lol it was celebrating the find too I guess.,y2cgs4
Return it one round at a time.,y2cgs4
More donations to Ukraine. I am sure u will find a way to put it to good use.  😆,y2cgs4
This was posted almost a month ago.,y2cgs4
Even that bee wants some ammo for its kalash against the Invaders,y2cgs4
Praise the Lord and pass the ammunition,y2cgs4
"The bee in the beginning of the video is like 'what are watching here? Lemme read this too""",y2cgs4
Nice donation to the UAF by Russia. A receipt is in the return barrels.,y2cgs4
"No wonder they can’t arm their conscripts, all the ammo is right there!!! Lol",y2cgs4
Poor engineers having to look through that for combat worthiness thats a months work for 2 teams at least,y2cgs4
Return to sender,y2cgs4
Wow! I hope you can return it to them just as fast as they left!!,y2cgs4
Oh boy I hope the war ends soon and maybe if we are lucky some of that 7.62x54r will flood the market.,y2cgs4
"Return it all back to the rightful owner, ALL OF IT 💥💥💥🤭",y2cgs4
Maybe the bees scared them off. Time to return those at top speed,y2cgs4
Return to sender.,y2cgs4
"After the War when Ukraine WINS there will be a surplus market for Russian ammo. But if Ukraine is smart disperse ammo through out the country for ""future"" use .",y2cgs4

Where are their glorious attack vehicles? all I see is soft skinned vehicles,y2en9b
![gif](giphy|h5NLPVn3rg0Rq),y2en9b
Can't wait for them to show up in videos as dead bodies next to their shot up vehicles,y2en9b
This is so tragic. Chechens should be fighting for their own independence like their fathers and grandfathers and generations before them. I think this is the first time in their entire history they are serfs. Very sad.,y2en9b
Might as well be fertilizer,y2en9b
180000 tiny tungsten balls x6 would take care of this issue pretty quickly.,y2en9b
Half of  the convoy was the goat transports.,y2en9b
"Lots of armored pick up trucks and busses, wonder how well those protect against mortars?",y2en9b
"Watch out, nazi stop signs and traffic lights!",y2en9b
This would be an amazing demonstration of the new infantry shredding Himars rounds.,y2en9b
"No more armor left.  

No wonder Belarus is giving putin tanks",y2en9b
"Warm and sunny and dry. 

But much of the video coming out of Ukraine lately shows cloudy, cool and wet weather.

Am I overthinking this if I'm wondering if this is a recycled video from some months ago?",y2en9b
Reminds me of ISIS or cartel videos with their long pickup truck convoys and abundant amount of dudes decked out in tactical gear with no idea how to use it.,y2en9b
"Need one of these to fly by 😈

![gif](giphy|VicskjkeBJUD6)",y2en9b
"Last time a convoy of these dudes entered, it was February and they all tucked tail and ran 8 weeks later after taking heavy losses.",y2en9b
"excellent, those 10,000 Ukes arriving from training

need plenty of fresh targets",y2en9b
And Que M30/A1 in 3...2...1..........PINK MIST!!!! SLAVA UKRAINI!!!! HEROIAM SLAVA!!!!,y2en9b
Mr. Himars welcomes you to Ukraine.,y2en9b
There's no armor... or supplies. Are they at a gas station?,y2en9b
"Remember the long long line of trucks and tanks at the start of the war? Had everyone scared? But I was like… how are they gonna fill up? Eat? Piss and shit? Sleep? They had logistics problems right from the start. If I could see that, I’m not versed in war at all…There’s strength in numbers, clumping together if you’re say…fish. But they’re in Ukraine now, it’s really war there, I mean…good target!",y2en9b
"Where is the BBRRRRTTT of an A10 warthog when you need it eh? 

Send all these goat fuckers on the express train to hell.",y2en9b
I hope they get a proper “welcome to Ukraine” Big Bang.,y2en9b
"I don't see any armour, maybe served them okay in Chechnya, but this is a completely  different ball, game as I am aware they no doubt will find out",y2en9b
R.I.P. one of the top Chechen anti Russia has also arrived in Ukraine.....and is firming a unit to fight this s.....hit.,y2en9b
"Based on their convoy, they didn’t get the news about the new HIMARS ammo Ukraine received… oh well.",y2en9b
These mothereffers done did it now. They are going to be served up some HIMARS M30A1 and M777 Excalibur munitions. Rain of steel! Death from above. Allah cannot save them now.,y2en9b
Where are the HIMARS? I think this would be perfect opportunity to shine,y2en9b
Get a himar on their position,y2en9b
"Won't be any retreating conscripts now, bitches!!",y2en9b
"All shiny new busses, trucks, gear, etc.  Give it a week.",y2en9b
We really should give the Ukrainians a couple of A10 Warthogs make short work of these pussys,y2en9b
Bunch of dead fucks,y2en9b
A lot of people. Not a lot of military hardware.,y2en9b
"These Chechens have 3 jobs, none of which involve actual combat.

1. Make TikToks
2. Make sure none of the 300,000 mobilized soldiers retreat.
3. Fuck goats

and Glory to the Sheikh Mansur battalion, The Real Chechens.",y2en9b
They'll all die.,y2en9b
Nothing but truck and men. Good luck against Himars and artillery,y2en9b
Short bus... perfect,y2en9b
Hope they all meet their demise,y2en9b
Just in time for the freshly trained troops that are on their way back from the UK.,y2en9b
This can be geolocated - there is a gas station but it's an unknown brand to me. The prices of gas look in rubles.,y2en9b
"It is absolutely insane to me that they still allow their movements to be broadcast but whatever, keep doing you I guess",y2en9b
"HIMARS, dinner!",y2en9b
"I’ll put my money on the 10,000 newly NATO trained and armed Ukrainians every day of the week over these Soviet armed, at best, shit heads",y2en9b
More 🎯target practice for Ukrainian soldiers!! Slava UKRAINI 💪🏻🇺🇦💪🏻🇺🇦💙💛🌻❤️,y2en9b
Time for some tungsten rain...,y2en9b
"I see lots of troops, not much support...",y2en9b
gloss paint will work wonders,y2en9b
"Oh look, no armor. 

🎵 Farewell and adieu to you fair Spanish ladies...",y2en9b
1 HIMAR round could take care all of that,y2en9b
Welcome to the rice fields mother❌❌❌❌ers,y2en9b
"What kind of gas station (company) is that? Does it exist in Ukraine? 

I know OKKO and WOG are green in Ukraine but the gas station in the video doesn't seem to be either. 

Also some gas station named Parallel is also green in Ukraine.",y2en9b
Let it rain tungsten and steel.,y2en9b
Russian LGBT rally,y2en9b
Shame a Himars didn't lock on.,y2en9b
More dead trees to come,y2en9b
are they going to a school trip iwith those  busses?,y2en9b
chechen kababs soon,y2en9b
"Long life to Axmat Kadyrov and remember, Allah Ahkbar! 😂",y2en9b
Great. The Ukrainians will have the Welcome Wagon waiting for 'em.,y2en9b
"That's handy. At the 15s mark, text on side of bus says GERM!

Bus load of viruses detected. Check.

Load the anti virus HIMARS syringe. Check.

Launch tactical anti viral syringe when ready to rid the world of another plague of unwanted virus filth from the east.",y2en9b
"The sooner those goat fuckers become fertilizer ,the better",y2en9b
"Convoy of what appears to be mostly painted civilian vehicles, a few army trucks.   Of course if they are just the enforcers in the rear, shooting at stop signs, they don't need armored transportation.  Frankly I don't trust anything they post, this could be anywhere, at any time, and just another propaganda video.",y2en9b
"Welcome, my sons. Welcome, to the meat-grinder.",y2en9b

Where’s the barrel so we can fish???? 💥,y2en9b
Easy meat,y2en9b
"Cool I’ll see them close up, rotten and/or burned for the next few weeks",y2en9b
Half of these guys will come back without limbs just from hypothermia,y2en9b
I totally don’t understand what’s the pride for chechens to fight in this…,y2en9b
"At 29 seconds into the video, is that green & white gas station sign with red numbering a Ukrainian brand of gas station?",y2en9b
They'll be pushing up sunflowers in the spring. 🌻🌻🌻,y2en9b
We should give Ukraine some A-10 warthogs.,y2en9b
"If those KadyrovCunts were smart they would turn back  now, cause they are about to get lit up by HIMARS",y2en9b
I was waiting for it to go BOOM!,y2en9b
Bring out the HEEMARS!!,y2en9b
"Hear me out…. A10 Brrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrt 
Straight down the parade. I know it’s not possible but wouldn’t that be a sight",y2en9b

The Ukrainians will have a huge collection of new vehicles 🚜🚜🚜,y2en9b
Himars,y2en9b
A target rich environment.,y2en9b
What tine is it.... it's HIMAR time.,y2en9b
Oh look it's the goat f@ckers.,y2en9b
Russia is so pathetic.  Supposed to be a world power yet 7 months in is pulling every staw it can.  Iran drones. Bellarus equipment.  Threats to use Belarus army. Use of chechens.  They can't even fund and supply their own war they started based on their own resources.  🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣,y2en9b
"fuckman, some A10's or Ukrainian Su-25's, or even MiG-29's doing a few strafing on those dirty muslim Allah piece of shit garden gnomes would be beautiful. Kill them before they even get off the trucks. Even some GMLRS rounds from the M140 or M270 right up their hairy asses. I hate those Chechen garden Gomes more than regular Russians.",y2en9b
These dicks have no idea what they are getting into. Its disgusting to see the worst kind of lackeys flying the flag of a country that bombed their capital. Slaves.,y2en9b
That's a lot of gear and people that are about to be destroyed in about 20 min by a few HIMARS,y2en9b
"That would make them fair game, correct?",y2en9b
At what point is ukraine going to attack with the drone  and how big of a damage would it be only one attack ? If they are lined up like that,y2en9b
It’s like a convoy of pigs going to the slaughterhouse…… there’s nothing protection them. How stupid are you really to do that,y2en9b
"Sheep who's fathers were wolf's,",y2en9b
 🚌‘S  & 🛻‘S,y2en9b
get ready for the tiktok battalion 1.5,y2en9b
Nice weather.  Summertime ?,y2en9b
Next to no armored vehicles. Good job guys.,y2en9b
"Why do we think this is in Ukraine?

Give the floor to HIMARS please,y2en9b
Where are Himars when one needs them…,y2en9b
Considering how many troops get killed everyday this is like barely a week's worth of guys.,y2en9b
They’ll get destroyed on the battlefield but I worry about what these animals will do to civilians in their AO,y2en9b
Dead men. Fertilizer. Future flowers.,y2en9b
Half that convoy has to be filled with inflatable sheep.,y2en9b

"Im German i can can translate-> 
So they are mainly screaming to the Ukrainans : 
""nazis raus"" 
witch means
 ""nazis get out of here""
Witch means they adapt directly the Russian propaganda of so called ""de Nazi fiction""
Witch of course is bullshit.
As a German i am a shamed of these fools
I hope Ukraine wins 🇪🇺🇩🇪🤝🇺🇦",y23ako
“Russians in Germany screaming hateful things….”,y23ako
German guy here: Fuck them.,y23ako
Not people but ruzzians,y23ako
Never mind those guys.,y23ako
It's an absolute minority screaming hateful things. Like 2 people.,y23ako
"These Russians or whoever yelling ""nazis"" need a hard look in the mirror.  The only nazis are themselves.  My god when will they stop and grow up. Go back or go to Russia.  So tired of these asshats spewing their hate for Ukrainians and love for Russia OUTSIDE of Russia.  The nerve.",y23ako
Paradox of tolerance is relevant here,y23ako
"It’s not really hateful what they shout, but ”Nazis raus“, which means ”Nazis go away“. Utterly stupid, because they themselves would be the Nazis in this case.",y23ako
Putler jugends,y23ako
I'm lost. So what are they belting on about? russia is a German state??,y23ako
Ahh. The brightest lights of society,y23ako
"They should be instantly deported to russia because of national security reasons or something, whatever... Fucking assholes. Try to do this in Poland you pieces of shit.",y23ako
Just a loud minority. Thats what you have to endure in a free democrazy.,y23ako
"I think we should really start send those pootler supporters to russia, where they belong…",y23ako
Those are most likely Russians living in Germany or Germans with Russian roots. Germany overall is entirely behind UA which is also consistently shown in all opinion polls,y23ako
Some idiots in Germany would be more precise.,y23ako
"They screem ""Nazis raus"", which means ""Nazis out"".

This is ironic, because I assume they are right winged extremists (Pegida, AfD, ""Der dritte Weg"", NPD, etc...).

Keep in mind, this is only a tiny minority of idiots in germany that actually believe the putlin propaganda of Ukraine has been taken over by Nazis... The absurdity of calling the victims of Nazis, which have a jewish leader, nazis themself... by the ancestors of the nazis, is priceless and a special kind of dumb.",y23ako
"Yep, its getting a problem in Germany and it grows even worse and worse.   
The right wing party got 10% in a normaly rather mid or left state o the last vote.   


Tbh, I get that they are opset. The world and mostly europe is always asking germany for help and money and the poorest germans get the feeling of missing out or being over looked.   


I personaly stand 100% with ukraine and I will proudly life through the winter with out lots of heating, because I think europe needs to stand together and I fell blessed to be so lucky to life in such a safe and rich country.   
BUT I dont expect everyone to just understand it, specially the poor and less educated ppl.",y23ako
"It is complete Bullshit and a waste article...

The people yelling at the Ukrainians are most likely supporters of the Germany Party AFD, which ist radicals right (kinda Nazis), or Russians living in Germany...

I am German, I am totally offended by this und these people and unfortunately you can find fuckheads everywhere... 

I personally do not now anybody in Germany that would support RuZZia,....  


The article must be some kind of clickbait stuff.... nobody cares about those motherfuckers over here and i'd say that 99,99% of the Germans stand or would stand with Ukraine...(Sorry, I wouldn't grand ofr the 0,01% of Darwin Award suckers... :D)",y23ako

Makes me smile that people choose to believe 1 news source in a time where endless free and trustworthy newscources exist.",y23ako
What are all of these Russians doing in Germany? Hiding from conscription?,y23ako
"Funny when the real nazis shout ”get out Nazis”, we should let their wish become reality and deport them",y23ako
"It's probably a bunch of Russian immigrants that are screaming this bullshit at the Ukrainians. The problems with them is they are neither Russian nor German, so they pick whatever they feel like on a given day. They came back in the 90s because of their German roots. My wife is one of them with her being the exception but for most of them a German shepherd was and will be most German thing they have in their lifes. 
 To me these assholes should go back to Russia to their supreme leader.",y23ako
Russian tourists?,y23ako
"So the Day I never ever thought would come, is actually here; when Germans shouting ”Nazis get out” to Ukrainian families.",y23ako

So misleading. I was just in Germany and they all support Ukrainian to the fullest! I did not see or hear one person talking positively about Russia.,y23ako
[deleted],y23ako
"Many are just anti-establishment people. They follow telegram channels spewing their own propaganda. If the government takes a position, they will take the opposite and believe any conspiracy they hear from their “gurus”. Others are generally fascists and right wingers against NATO, Biden the US etc, so they’re pro Putin by reflex. There are many who don’t believe main stream, they’d rather believe their own conspiracies and that we all live in a fiction. They’re a minority though. They are lost, will probably never come back to their senses..",y23ako
"these people have found each other in the pandemic and live completely in their conspiracy-theory telegram groups. they are an established part of the neo-nazi scene (by the way, they shout ""nazis out"", which exposes them as absolute degenerates) and constantly make some kind of demos where they attack journalists, harass people and want to spread their sick thoughts. people have already been murdered by these cringe-terrorists.important: these people are a very small (but extremely) radical splinter group. they do not represent the opinion of the germans.",y23ako

Seriously those stupid fucks don’t even know what I yelled at them but they where approving it, while holding russian flags 😅 I thought antivaxxers where stupid but those guys damn. Why don’t they move to Russia if it’s so great over there? I’m sure the Kremlin Gremlin is gonna need some motivated conscripts.",y23ako

"Those are most likely Russians that fled Russia some time ago already, probably have German citizenship too, but can’t stand it that there are brave people standing up to Russian aggression rather than chickening out like the cowards that they are…as a result they drown themselves in Russian propaganda and hold on to Russianness like crazy, without having any real perspective or distance to what’s going on…",y23ako
"As a German all I can say to that: Haltet eure Gehirnwasche fresse und übernehmt nicht dumme Zitate aus russischen Fernsehen. Schaut euch die Geschichte an von ru und Ukraine, Russland hat einen Friedensvertrag mit der Ukraine gebrochen den die beiden Länder geschlossen haben, weil die Ukraine sowjetische Nuklearwaffen abgegeben hat (die in der Ukraine stationiert waren während der sowjet Zeit und die Ukraine die nicht wollte oder nutzen konnte). Erinnert ihr euch an einen Österreicher der einen Friedensvertrag gebrochen hat um seine größenwahnsinnigen Welt-Machtsfantasien umsetzen zu können.

Russian colleges of mine are all watching Russian news in Germany and all are saying that „Putin told them not to come close to the borders“ and now my question to you guys. Ukraine is like a small boy attacked by a bully. What Russia doesn’t now is that Ukraine has a big brother ready to fight.
What should Ukraine do? Accept to be killed just because is smaller? Fuck Putin and fuck all the brainwashed idiots in 2022…use your phones that are way smarter then you and read. Inform yourself about history and what is really happening. And if you still stay at the same idea that Europe and the whole west are nazi because they have another understanding of humanity then stay there where are more of you…don’t come here…Russians in Germany are shouting „we love Russia“ then go back and drive Lada.

"I, as a German, am back. 
Yes, I said that yesterday in a similar post. 
I am ashamed of so much stupidity. And as I said, the East Germans have been under Russian rule for too long. I can't say why this generation is doing this shit? Are these descendants of the Stasi? Or actually Russians living in Germany... both is possible. 
The majority of the nazis are in the former DDR.

They are stupid as hell, old white men and younger Neo Nazis mostly and full of hatred agains everything... just losers but nasty. and cowards. Still dangerous and they need to be taken serious. When they are calling Ukrains ""Nazis raus"" its just a disinformation and to confuse the public, this also blurs the topic Neo Nazism (they took a Jew Star on their coats  with the word ""no vaccinated"" insted of ""Jew"" and went on demonstrations agains Corona vaccination a year ago... . They exactly know that Ukrainians are not Neo Nazis but they stick to the Moskau textbook.",y23ako

isn't it a pretty serious offense to call someone a nazi in germany?,y23ako
I’m sure although vocal and apparently pretty irate they are mislead (by Russian Propaganda) and truly in the majority. Given their sentiment I think they are ‘full of wind’ as if not they would have joined the losers on the other side.,y23ako

Edit: On closer look I don’t think even the trailers match.

They said it IS two different vehicles. They never claimed the truck in the xray and from the cctv were the same truck.

They stated the truck in the xray transported the explosives from gerogia to armenia then transferred onto the truck from the cctv video.",y27d7l
"Of course they are different because they are two different trucks. The X-ray is taken from border with Georgia when cargo crossed Russian border on a different truck. None ever said it’s the same.
The one that was blown was not X-ray scanned. 
And that was told from the very beginning.

But you sure can still spread misinformation or just a lie.",y27d7l
"Only in Russia the trucks can drive with the support legs holding the trailer up, but of course you can only see it on X-ray 🤦‍♂️",y27d7l
Their military has been a joke but their propaganda/misinformation game has been disappointingly embarrassing. The Ukrainians have handed them their ass in every facet of this war so far.,y27d7l
These pictures are for their own blind people. We all know they won’t be looking carefully anyway.,y27d7l
"It reminds me of the one situation where they showed ""evidence"" of Nazis in Ukraine. It's the photo with ""The Sims 3"" which was funny as hell.

They are incompetent because it's only for domestic consumption but also because corruption is everywhere in Russia. I heard that you could buy a position in military if you pay enough so it's not that far fetched to think that you can buy position in inteligence division or something similar.",y27d7l
They forgot the old mafia saying. When you lie. Be brief.,y27d7l
What allies?,y27d7l
They such dumbs.,y27d7l
"Even if it was an x-ray of Fred Flintstones car the ruZZian people would believe it.
They have been brainwashed for generations.",y27d7l
Made me remember that video from start of the war where they put The SIMS games instead SIM cards.,y27d7l
My god Russia is just the worst XD,y27d7l
"I'm out of the loop, what were they trying to prove with these pictures?",y27d7l
"You guys all make it seem like a no-brainer, but I had to come to the comments to figure out what I was looking at. Caveat: I’m a female, so that might have something to do with it, but also if I was serious about it, I would make an effort to see an X-ray on a different rig to compare",y27d7l
"Wow, 🤤 and I'm sure Russian still believe it because this isn't the first horrible propaganda I've seen from Russia. Russians living in Russia are gullible and easily tricked and brainwashed. They don't even realize that they are slaves.",y27d7l
[deleted],y27d7l
"Russian agents are reported to have took the instructions ""3 sim cards"" as in storage cards. Russia wanted to plant evidence that Ukraine had Nazis and that instruction was interpreted to leave ""Sims 3"" as plain as day proof of Nazi involvement. Honestly, by comparison, this is fucking Einstein league propaganda here.",y27d7l
"Did you mean FSB, not UAF ?  I'm confused.",y27d7l
The only one who believes this lies is Puttin him self.,y27d7l
"From Bulgaria, cargo arrived to Georgian port of Poti by sea, then it was loaded onto a truck with foreign numbers and taken to Armenia, where cargo cleared customs. After that truck entered Georgia, from where it headed to Russia and arrived in Armavir. 22 pallets were reloaded onto another truck, which went towards the Crimea. X-ray picture is from Georgia customs, truck on picture is European DAF. Trailer is different as well. American truck was used to deliver cargo to Crimea. Red truck was only visually inspected.",y27d7l
It's a cloud with glasses calm down mate,y27d7l
Man I’m glad y’all know what’s happening here cause I sure didn’t lol,y27d7l
"U don't have to look that far, just check the spare and the space from the edge of the trailer, 2 different trucks, NaZZi RuZZia thinks everybody is like their MAGA followers",y27d7l
Putin's propaganda is as poor as that of the old Soviet Union.,y27d7l

It's almost a troll post.  Nukes for a nuke is a world ender.  We need to wipe them out the old fashioned way if they dare try it.,y2u5mi
"Of course. NATO said it a thousand times already: If Russia does that, they will *conventionally* delete the Russian forces in Ukraine, Crimeea and the Black Sea.

Answering a nuke with a nuke would lead to the world's end in about a week.",y2u5mi
"The US has this same stance. A tactical nuke will pull our airforce and navy into the fight, officially. Obliteration of everything Russian in Ukraine (Crimea included) would be complete within days.",y2u5mi
"Make sense, if I am not mistaken European countries don't have a great number of tactical nukes and the majority of them are part of the nuclear sharing with the US.",y2u5mi
Russia using Nukes in Ukraine is like pissing in the wind. It will all just blow back on them.,y2u5mi
"Everyone marvels at HIMARS - one tactical nuke and you will see the fun from F15’s - F35’s - F22’s - F16’s - B1‘s - B2’s - B52’s - US cruise missiles - and assorted other toys in the US arsenal. Go ahead Vlad - make my day…

oh I forgot…your Kerch bridge will be parked next to the Moscow in the first hour",y2u5mi
"i guess that you have the geopolitical knowlegde of a 4th grader ?
Using nukes against nukes is ww3 aka the end of our civilisation
the occidental doctrine are that nukes are only used as a retaliation of attack on its own territory... Nukes are not toys",y2u5mi
"This is no different to what the US has said. NATO doesn't need nukes to crush the Russian military in Ukraine. However, if Russia was to use a second nuke against NATO forces, all bets are off.",y2u5mi
Imagine not understanding the article and suggesting France is surrendering.,y2u5mi
That's just dumb to say. Even if France won't use nukes due to its doctrine he just should have been ambiguous.. Maybe we will nuke the shit out of Moscow  maybe not.,y2u5mi
Talk about showing your hand before its played,y2u5mi
He could've kept that to himself,y2u5mi
"Hopefully when ruSSia is in pieces after Ukraine break them, all the Countries with nukes can get rid of 99% of them.",y2u5mi
"Eventually NATO will come out with a joint statement basic lay saying that if a nuclear weapon is used in Ukraine, NATO nuclear weapons will not be deployed.

The scope of whatever operations would be conducted in reply, would be announced and likely limited to Ukraine only. Retired US generals pretty much stated what would be appropriate if Russia uses a nuclear weapon:

1) the destruction of Russian forces inside of Ukraine as is recognized by the international community
2) the black sea fleet would be sunk

This is just talk that eventually will form into NATOs official policy on a what if scenario in a attempt to limit this conflict from spreading.",y2u5mi
Of course France won't do anything.  All they have to do is stand there and look tough because they know their boy America is already dragging knuckles from across the bar,y2u5mi
I’m frankly surprised the French haven’t surrendered already,y2u5mi
"Emmanuel ""Let's not humiliate Putin"" Macron.",y2u5mi
Marcon has a fetish for Putins table…,y2u5mi
He is probably concerned about humiliating Putin,y2u5mi
"It would have been better to be ambiguous and not talk about it, but sadly macron ignored his own advice! His statement will embolden Putin",y2u5mi
"ag France, russia isnt interested in you, stop stitching those white flags and you dont have to sign those surrender forms!!",y2u5mi
"I think they should make different statements to make it more unpredictable for Russia. 

France will “delete” everything Russia has in Ukraine and the other can retaliate with nukes into Russia. I think that might even be worse for Russia.",y2u5mi
Well why not,y2u5mi
He didn’t even have to say that but since he did its like hes giving putin permission to. Smh,y2u5mi
"I recall US, British and France all agreed to protect Ukraine from nukes in one treaty when Ukraine gave up their nukes? No?",y2u5mi
That could be a good thing without Macron's finger on the button!,y2u5mi
So France it's already surrendering 😆 a nuclear war hasn't even started they say history repeats itself and its true.,y2u5mi
Nope but be sure to make men into woman,y2u5mi
"Nobody gives a fuck if you do or not, Macron. The heavy lifters of the west will take care of business, if it ever becomes necessary. God forbid. But thanks for showing Putin that your resolve is weak, and your support of Ukraine is limited and conditional. Good job of wiffle-waffling, froggie.",y2u5mi
Fucking stupid,y2u5mi
To be fair when nuclear war is on the table nobody says oh no France😂 it’s all Russia and the USA,y2u5mi

Wait for them to finish repairing it and then 💥 lol,y2bjg8
Just a scratch they said 😂😂,y2bjg8
Looks like a couple more targets are loitering around.,y2bjg8
Time to hit that bridge again and finish the job.,y2bjg8
this was a huge impact. Even Chuck Norris would be proud of the results!,y2bjg8
"From what I've read, the rail system is the most important for Russia's military transport. From that perspective, isn't the case that only one of the rail lines still remains under repair?",y2bjg8
"Not a problem for the second best military in the world.

(for illustrative purposes only)",y2bjg8
"Yeah, just put a band aid on that and it'll be back in operation in no time.",y2bjg8
Just imagine the pressure wave bending this massive steel structure within a millisecond.,y2bjg8
"So glad Putin, you have cash for this, when you can't even pay a proper pension to your elderly. Or give them any health care. Maybe you could return the money you got super rich on, to help your equal citizens of Russia. Oh, it's not equal, is it?",y2bjg8
What's the word on the train track?,y2bjg8

are they stripping the asphalt off of the one span because they plan to put it back into place?,y2bjg8
"First image shows concrete spall damage on the bridge support ([bent](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bent_(structural))).

Are the rail posts bent away from the blast's center? Was the focus of the blast the rightmost lane of the fallen span. There are marks on the decking as well.",y2bjg8

"I've seen photos of how quick the Japanese have filled in sink holes. If this had happened there, this bridge would be back to being fully operational by now. Get with it Russia lol",y2bjg8
"Actual state of the bridge today:

https://imgur.com/a/8GIUGeb",y2bjg8
😂🤣😂,y2bjg8
"I'm still struggling to work out what caused this though.  Two spans were knocked out, but they're not adjacent to each other.  I would expect them both to be beside each other if they were caused by a truck bomb.  It's like there was two explosions, one hitting each span which doesn't match with a single truck bomb.

But if it was sappers setting explosives under the bridge I'd expect them to hit both sides of the road, not just one side.",y2bjg8
How about some of those bunker buster missiles? It might be overkill but it's time to finish the job.,y2bjg8
"It's about time to spare one HIMARS rocket Friday.

Just to remind them.",y2bjg8
Gonna be fixed probably faster than Ukraine will have electricity and water.,y2bjg8

EDIT: corrected traduction. its half ukrainian half russian

EDIT2: Camera is watching west at the sunset, and indeed it looks like the interception missiles are launching from Belgorod to something flying from the east

EDIT3: Clear picture [here](https://imgur.com/a/znpn7cQ). Zchannels claim they shot down AGM-88 HARM missiles launched by Ukraine.",y294vy
Seem like putin is tired of Belarus and its president not getting behind Russia and supporting them in the special military operation as he like,y294vy

"Eh. If it shoots even moderately accurate it's worth using. The towed artillery they have been using isn't much more advanced. The rounds would be the issue. Theyre either detonate as intended, be duds, or explode in the barrel. Russias army is such shit that this is the least of their worries. Old artillery is still artillery",y2824d
Bow and arrows are next in the inventory.,y2824d
This retro fashion craze is getting out of control!,y2824d
It's no M777 but I don't want to be shelled by them. Still plenty devastating.,y2824d

"“I’m going to need 20 rolls of duct tape and a case of beer”

To fix it?

“Oh, no. I just like drinking beer and duct taping things. This bridge is eff’d”",y28dse
They will lift it back up and glue it,y28dse
gonna need a bigger bomb,y28dse
Looks like those skillful russians are gonna try to pull up that damaged section and prop it back up..also that bridge looks pretty flimsy looking at the underside of the span structure.,y28dse
Ukrainian military: providing jobs to Russian construction workers. Again. And again. And again. Keep it up fellas!,y28dse
Let's hope they slap it together too fast and the train drives off and destroys the bridge again as soon as they transfer military equipment across it. 🤞,y28dse
Beautiful repair so that you blow up the same 😉👍👏,y28dse
Yeh but what about the broken span top right of picture ?,y28dse
"good to see they still don't use the ""undamaged"" opposite side of the track for transport.

seems that side of the track is also occupied by repair wagons.",y28dse
This was only Ukraines first attempt at attacking the bridge and it was successful! This bridge is Putins legacy and he promised the world that it would never be attacked. There will be many more. It's only rumors but Ukraine has big summer plans potentially.,y28dse
Be hilarious when they hit it again lol,y28dse
Let them fix it and then go for the support pillars. There'll be no fixing that quickly.,y28dse
Wait until completely finished and hit it again ! That would drive Putin over the edge !,y28dse
Hit it!,y28dse
They should hit it again as the repair crews are driving away,y28dse

In it a journalist visits a recently liberated village, and sees loads of dead Russian troops dumped next to a road, which were abandoned by their comrades prior to running away. Also there is bonus footage of Ukrainian efforts to find and  recover the rotting bodies of dead Russian troops in the village laying in gardens etc, where their comrades had not bothered to collect them up even.",y1yguv

I thought they'd be a follow up.",y1wv7g
"As others have said this was a 2S3 Msta 152mm self propelled artillery unit.  And killing it is much, much better then killing a tank.  Absolutely the best use of whatever round was used to kill it.  I think it was not an Excaliber round but in the end it does not matter.",y1wv7g

"Nobody there in the tank could survive the shockwave blast. It rips your lung, your brains your lever... dead. The driver definitely didnt survive either...

I can't get the comical Belarus special forces video out of my head.,y22ve6
"Belarus Army and Belarus people don't have a beef with Ukraine.  Ukraine is not a threat to them, they have no territory claims, and do not want to fight Ukraine.  Likely be last days of their tin horn dictator if he orders them into the fight and he knows it.  Plus Belarus Army is only around 35,000 soldiers of which only a few thousand would be in units that could actually fight.",y22ve6
It won't impact Ukraine much but it will keep then as an independent country since Russia could take that as an easy win.,y22ve6
"""Belarus army would likely have little impact in Ukraine war.""

  
Agreed

But if they do enter the war, it would have an enormous impact on Belarus - and Lukashenko knows it.",y22ve6
Could be a negative impact. They might revolt and turn their guns the other way.,y22ve6
"What are the chances that Belarus will “donate”, most of its tanks to Russia?",y22ve6
Russia is 100% going to attack from Belarus. I'd put money on it. They are already flooding the area with fresh troops. I don't think russia even cares if they gain any ground they just want Ukraine to have to pull resources from the east and south giving russia a chance to take back some of the land they lost. They are flooding the south with new troops and tens of thousands of new goat fuckers. I wouldn't be surprised if we see another force enter in the north east.,y22ve6
"Re-opening the northern front with fresh (albeit poorly trained and equipped) soldiers would definitely have an impact in my opinion. It'd force the UA to redirect forces from the main fronts again, stretching the already overstreched Ukranian army.",y22ve6
"Dw, the rockets already had massive impact over the electricity and water.",y22ve6
Well it'd be more free kit for Ukraines army.,y22ve6
"""That's Colon Lukashenko to you! Now somebody give me a raw potato to eat!""",y22ve6
The illegals down here in Texas would make a better army than Belarus.,y22ve6

"**SOURCE:** telegram . me/i\_ponomarev/11413  
**ENGLISH:**  
\[Video\]  
Legion ""Freedom of Russia (telegram . me/legionoffreedom)"" is structurally part of the Foreign Legion, - said Caesar on the air of ""February Morning"". Now he is with his brothers near Bakhmut, this is at the moment the only sector of the front where the occupying troops are advancing. We also talked about the motivation of foreign volunteers (first of all, to stop Putin's horde before it moves further in the world).  
Well, about observations at the front: the cut of opinions about the future of Russia among the Ukrainian military is about the same as in the rear - 50% to 50% (ditch with crocodiles VS influence the reformatting of the northern neighbor). In fact, there is no choice here - either the Putin system, and the Russian Federation along with it, will be destroyed - and something new, acceptable and demilitarized will be created in its place, or the war will return again.  
They cut the conversation completely into a separate video (youtube . com/\_kWJoT60210)  
\----------------------------  
**RUSSIAN:**  
\[ Video \]  
Легион ""Свобода России (telegram . me/legionoffreedom)"" – структурно часть Иностранного легиона, - рассказал Цезарь в эфире ""Утро Февраля"". Сейчас он с побратимами под Бахмутом, это в данный момент единственный участок фронта, где оккупационные войска наступают. Поговорили также о мотивации иностранных добровольцев (в первую очередь – остановить путинскую орду до того, как она пойдет дальше по свету).   
Ну и про наблюдения на фронте: срез мнений о будущем России среди украинских военных примерно такой же как и в тылу – 50% на 50% (ров с крокодилами VS влиять на переформатирование северного соседа). На самом деле, тут выбора нет – или путинская система, и РФ вместе с ней, будет уничтожена – и на ее месте создано что-то новое, приемлемое и демилитаризованное, или война снова вернется.  
Вырезали беседу полностью в отдельный ролик (youtube . com/\_kWJoT60210)  
\----------------------------  
**TRANSLATION:**  
**Cesar:** Commanders are Ukrainian armed forces members. Organizationally we are designated as part of the Foreign Legion. Where we are among fighters from other countries of the world. Fighting together.  
**Ilya:** And are there many others?  
**Cesar:** There are volunteers from Poland, America, Canada. In the Foreign legion there even Koreans and Japanese, Brazillians and New Zealanders. In other words, the whole wide world stood up for the defense of Ukraine.  
**Ilya:** And what is their motivation. Here on Russian propaganda news they always say these are hired mercenaries. Although on the RF side, apparently their motivation is 'political'...  


**Cesar:** Yes, I understand, I perfectly understand. It is in the Kremlin's interests to say this because they measure everyone else by their own self-standards. I don't believe it is necessary to fight motivated only by money. On the contrary, many these foreign legion fighters took a decrease in earnings. Many of them were able to earn far more abroad with their jobs compared to serving in the armed forces now. The even say this ""we came here NOT for the money. We came here to defend core values of humanity."" The main value of humanity, is liberty. It is freedom to live how you want to. This is exactly what they came for. Because many understand that if Putin is not stopped right now, he will continue.  


**Ilya:** We recently conducted a psychological question survey among Ukrainians. Well, not us, the MOD of Ukraine did. But they have accommodated me in including some of the questions from our political center. And these questions regarded the future. And one of the questions was ""should Ukraine influence the future of Russia"". Should it participate in the creation of any future Russian government? The opinion of Ukrainians different 45% for and 45% against. 10% undecided. How are the folks at the front looking at this? Suppose the army comes to the border, what comes after? Will they follow on to Moscow, or build a fence, or is this even not being currently discussed?  


**Cesar:** Ilya, you were right in assessing the situation at a 50-50. So about half are forming their opinion like this: moat with crocodiles. About half would be ok with a crocodile moat where the other side can be across and live in isolation away from Ukraine. ""We want nothing to do with them after."" But on the other hand, the most interesting thing is that we the legionnaires with our actions are setting an example and are giving a chance not to only future citizens of Russia but also the citizens of Ukraine that in their future their neighbor would be a changed and improved nation. Who won't start reaching anywhere with their rockets and won't start destroying and robbing anyone. And that's going to give a chance for the future. Everyone perfectly understands now, though, if Putin's regime is not cut down, if it is not stopped, war will return to Ukraine later.",y1z4jj

"Technically Ukraine won’t be able or allowed to join until this war has concluded and there is no disputed territory. Ongoing territorial conflicts make membership impossible.

No chance we let them in while they are actively engaged in a war. Would that automatically trigger article 5? Is there some way to let them in and say Article 5 doesn’t apply to “this war”. Once they defeat Russia and cleanse their lands of the invaders I hope that NATO accepts them. But even then I don’t think Turkey will allow it. Erdogan is too much of a Putin sycophant.,y1b2a1

Not convenient for anyone for now,y1b2a1
It’s a lengthy process but they are trying to start it,y1b2a1
"I really think the sub is niave if they think Ukraine will simply be allowed to join NATO. 

First of all, there's a war. Nations will not be admitted during a war. Moreover, nations with border conflicts also won't be allowed to join, so in order for it to happen, the borders after the war would need to be solidified. (Let's say Ukraine fails to recapture Crimea, they would have to officially ""give it up"" to make Nato membership feasible.

Secondly, Ukraine was and still is a nation with lots of corruption, only less corrupt than its current neighbour and occupier, so that would need to be dealt with before anything could realistically occur.

Thirdly, even if both above issues were remedied, even with ""fast track"", we are looking at several years at least, giving plenty of time for Russia to try again (at which point the clock would likely reset).

Lastly, and arguably most importantly, the EU may not want to take the risk. It's likely insuring a car driver who has multiple Not at fault claims. Yes, it may not be their fault, but that still makes them wary about the decision. This will likely delay the event by several more years",y1b2a1
It might. Go figure,y1b2a1
It won’t happen as long as the war is still there.,y1b2a1
It’s like trying to get home owners insurance as your house is burning down,y1b2a1
That is extremely unlikely. WW3 will most likely start that day if that’s the case.,y1b2a1
Yes I wish we would hurry up already shit since putin wants to try to fake annex a few cities in Ukraine why not lock it down by letting Ukraine in then if he wants a fight well lets just say u can't keep hitting on our people,y1b2a1
"It will take a few years for Ukraine to join NATO, but it sure as hell pisses Russia.",y1b2a1
At this point it's NATO that should join Ukraine,y1b2a1
Ukraine has proved it deserves to join NATO.,y1b2a1
Let's hope not,y1b2a1
"it’s definitely not going to happen. can’t join nato with an active conflict going on. otherwise joining would mean instantly triggering article 5 which would mean the majority of the richest countries in the combined largest GDP union would be at war. that would destroy the world economy in a day. literally millions would die in the weeks to follow just from the economical impact. 

nah… joining nato wouldn’t help anyone. it would be the opposite effect - freeing ukraine at the cost of the world economy makes zero sense. but i’m all for sending them a shit ton of equipment and money. take all my taxes don’t care. there just needs to be something left to fight for at the end of the day.",y1b2a1
"Allowing Ukraine to join NATO, even with territory disputes, but with the stipulation that article 5 will not go into effect for this conflict unless nukes are used is actually the response needed to balance out Pootin’s nuclear threats. 

Before it’s been Pootin making all these threats about nuking everyone if he doesn’t get his way. Maybe it’s time to uno reverse. 2023 is going to be interesting.",y1b2a1
No way. Horrible idea. Mindless escalation is not the solution to this no-win situation.,y1b2a1
"As much as I’d love it to happen, it’s currently impossible. NATO can’t accept nations that are at war.",y1b2a1
Never thought i would see the day everyone is rubber stamping another world war,y1b2a1
"No, NATO won't accept a nation at war.",y1b2a1
Just one leg through the door is all ukraine needs.,y1b2a1
Is there a limitation as to how far a nation can be from the North Atlantic to join NATO?,y1b2a1
The application? Yes. Acceptance? Not any time soon.,y1b2a1
"No, it wont happen as the state of the world is today. NATO has been extremely clear on where they stand in this regard.",y1b2a1
"Not a chance, fortunately for the rest of the world.

It's a real shame this wasn't bottomed out a few years ago as we're past that point now. 

More economic and military support to Ukraine is the best we can offer. 

It's sad because they're stuck indefinitely as our, the wests, proxy.",y1b2a1
Look how much it's taking Finland & Sweden (in the middle of an international crisis on top) and one other NATO rule is that you're not supposed to have territorial disputes with your neighbor.,y1b2a1
Let them in damnit!,y1b2a1
"I think they should be in NATO, but it won't happen now. All 30 members must approve and I can't see them getting everyone on board while at war with ruzzia.",y1b2a1
disputed borders make a country ineligible.,y1b2a1
Ukraine joining nato would be a beautiful thing,y1b2a1
It's like trying to buy life insurance after being diagnosed with cancer,y1b2a1
 No,y1b2a1
"I submitted an application to run for President in 2024...

Is it finally happening?!?!

The answer is no to both.",y1b2a1
"To answere your question, no",y1b2a1
they won't be admitted into nato until their territories are reclaimed.  i don't think they will be admitted if there's an ongoing conflict either.  it would have to be when ukraine wins and is quickly admitted into nato to avoid any future confrontations with russia,y1b2a1
They won’t admit them while the war is ongoing since it would automatically trigger article 5,y1b2a1
There is enough corruption in NATO with Ukraine joining.,y1b2a1
"No, NATO can't take in new members with ungoing territorial conflicts.",y1b2a1
No,y1b2a1
WW3 is finally happening. how do I get out of Europe. I think the South Pole is safest.,y1b2a1
"Hope not - do we realize that if Ukraine was in nato, all of nato would be obligated to go to war with Russia?",y1b2a1
WW3 let's go!,y1b2a1
No its not likely and I won't happen the next 10years.,y1b2a1
"If so, ruzzia as we all know it will be part of the past. And oh boy I know we all hope for this.",y1b2a1
We won’t see it happen in our lifetime,y1b2a1
"Obviously, no.

1. Ukraine is at war. Might Russia win in the end despite all the problems, would Ukraine have an unbelievable problem.
2. Ukraine has huge democracy problems. At the moment, NATO struggles enough with democracy issues. They can't handle another problematic state.
3. Ukraine has a big problem with corruption. NATO does not need more problems with corruption.",y1b2a1
Yesss... It is finally happening... Nuclear war coming...just don't be surprised if Russia nearly swipes out Ukraine's population due to decisions of the joker...after full scale destruction of beautiful Ukraine u can feel free to join NATO...love from West...,y1b2a1
The table,y1b2a1
I'm curious who the other people at the table are. Presumably they're provincial governors? Do they have their own in-exile positions for rep's from the occupied regions?,y1b2a1
"Unless its a clear and convincing Ukrainian victory (Russia out of Donbass and Crimea), I doubt they'll let Ukraine in NATO after the war. There would be too many questions or interpretations on Article 5 and it would expose the many divisions among the NATO member states plus it would call their bluff on how willing they are to oppose Russia.",y1b2a1
They should set up a little train set that travels around the whole table. For a laugh.,y1b2a1
All the members should vote to accept them. But there are countries who obviously won't vote that easy. Turkiye and Hungary will be a problem.,y1b2a1
"That Turkish chucklefuck is still stalling on Sweden and Finland, so I doubt it will happen anytime soon.",y1b2a1
Start sending JDAMS!,y1b2a1
Can't happen fast enough. Send in the F-35s,y1b2a1
"I think they're discussing about what should've been done long ago. AA boosted x 3-4 times of the current arsenal. With this, even shooting 100 cruise missiles 0 would hit their target.   


Also Apache pilots should be trained as this war is gonna last. Can't figure better ways to clear entrenchments and push them back to Russia than a helo capable of shooting 8km aways with 30mm cannons during night and has a optics up to 50km away and automated target acquisition.

"I said from the beginning, I can see only one scenario in which this doesn't turn into WW3 and that's if the change in Russia comes from the inside, like someone shoots Putler etc.",y1b2a1
What will this mean for Article 5 if Ukraine gets Membership? Can it be enacted if a new member state is in active conflict when they join?,y1b2a1
"Suppose Ukraine joins, but then Belarus attacks Ukraine, would that be considered as part of an “ongoing conflict”, or does that bring about Article 5?",y1b2a1
"NATO should have already intervened. He has made it clear he wants the land, not the people.",y1b2a1
I mean no obviously. Sweden and Finland applied so so long ago and that still hasn't happened. And ukraine isn't as good of a candidate and is way more controversial. Definitely not happening for some time,y1b2a1
Keep your expectations real. Ukraine will not bed able to join NATO while at war with Russia.,y1b2a1
Best table to use for circle jerking,y1b2a1
"Can anyone explain a situation in which Ukraine joining NATO in the middle of this conflict, ends well?

How do we avoid thermonuclear annihilation if this happens?",y1b2a1
Nah not until after the active conflict,y1b2a1
"I personally don't believe Ukraine joining NATO makes sense, at this specific point in time. However, and I believe this may be the plan, kicking Russia out of Ukraine first, and then insta-join NATO makes a while lotta sense to me, and I hope that's what's happening. I personally believe that's the plan. But that's just a feeling. I could easily be wrong.",y1b2a1
Imagine all this happening and nato is still like nah you don't meet the requirements fam 😂,y1b2a1
Hope you have patience.  This could a decade.,y1b2a1
Sorry putin already called dibs.,y1b2a1
Welcome,y1b2a1
"At this point, why is anyone against a conflict that results in ww3? Wasn't the whole point of ww2 that we finally said no to a regime that got it's way with violence and threats?",y1b2a1
They can't. Its literally illegal while Ukraine is engaged in an ongoing conflict.,y1b2a1
"A very interesting debate on this very topic here:-
 https://politics.stackexchange.com/questions/72191/could-nato-accept-a-new-member-who-is-at-war

There is nothing 'LEGALY' preventing Ukraine joining but it is highly unlikely there would be a unanimous vote to invite them.

As far as article 5 is concerned, it is up to the country involved to trigger it. For example the 1982 invasion of British territory by Argentina didn't cause the United Kingdom to trigger article 5 even though they theoretically could have.",y1b2a1
Do they submit a .pdf of their application then have to re-type it again on to the application portal?,y1b2a1
Unlikely they will allowed to join. Other nations friendly to Russia can veto. Certainly won’t happen during the ongoing conflict.,y1b2a1
"It will most likely be declined.  Hopeful that it doesn't but, it's obvious it will.",y1b2a1
"Isn't it a rule that a country can't just apply to join NATO, but has to be INVITED there? I am dumb at politics, so can please somebody explain? I've heard several people say that and that Ukraine still has to qualify on a lot of points to join, even with all the things they've achieved on the front line, etc.",y1b2a1
"No it won‘t, you can apply for anything that doesn‘t make it happen

Eventually it will, but not now",y1b2a1
World War 3?,y1b2a1
Lmao.. UA is not going to join NATO anytime soon..if ever..delusional,y1b2a1
There's no way. Nato most likely won't be joining nato unless Russia completely ceases to exist and all their nukes are acquired for.,y1b2a1
No it won’t happen,y1b2a1
"これはなんですかね？
ドラム缶を頭に被せて
何してますか？",y1b2a1
Somebody serve the caviar first 😅,y1b2a1
"No, but id gladly trade orban with ukraine",y1b2a1
"So, if Ukraine Joins NATO and Putin is still bombing babies if Ukraine is approved to join, does that instantly turn into a full-blown ""Nato"" situation like with any other attack on a nato country?",y1b2a1
"Not gonna happen. You can’t join NATO when you’re already at war and have disputed borders. Also, if they did join, NATO would basically be at war with Russia and no one wants that",y1b2a1
This will not end well,y1b2a1
Isn’t Ukraine joining NATO a surefire way to start WWIII?,y1b2a1
Patriot missile systems in Ukraine? Putin must be eating his shit pants right now.,y1b2a1
They can't join. They are at war,y1b2a1
"1sr off no-one can join Nato if they have a conflict or disputed border.
They are just sending the Join War request to EU, yes or no. We all know what Yes leads to, thus why they have those joining requirements. The proposal is on the table just in case of a Ru red line like a Nuke.
Then its gloves off & we delete the Ru culture. Fu russia",y1b2a1
"I think they should admit Ukraine, and give Russia a couple weeks to get the fuck out. If they don’t leave during the grace period, then it would activate article 5",y1b2a1
I agree with the application for Ukraine to join NATO. This is a start but will take some time and likely can not be processed until the Russian aggression is terminated.,y1b2a1
"I think it will be happening but as a peace insurance after Ukraine has kicked out Russia. A country in war can’t join Nato, thats agains Natos rules and one of the reason Putin invaded Donbas and so in in the first place. In say this rule is shit and that we should now tell all that Ukraine is a member. Then we attack Russia on a full-scale all in 🙂",y1b2a1
"Say for the sake of argument, Ukraine is accepted and joins NATO, will it act retroactively? Will NATO be able to put outside troops on the ground?",y1b2a1
"is it really possible ? 

if Ukraine join NATO the WW3 start instantly?",y1b2a1
"Lol... as if Ukraine would join NATO anytime soon. This will take many years.

But it's a strong signal to the east, that things will never be the same again.",y1b2a1
They should put plastic red cups in the middle and give everyone ping pong balls for when the meeting gets boring.,y1b2a1
"Had a dream last night that I met Volodymyr Zelensky in person. It was an awesome thought. Really is an inspiration of a leader.

Just think if NATO had an army like his under their belt. They'd have Russia contained for good!",y1b2a1
"Honestly speaking, if they were going to let Ukraine join NATO during this war, NATO would already be directly fighting in this war.",y1b2a1
Implying the minimum thresholds they were denied on last time have been solved since the war?,y1b2a1
Turkey and Hungary will veto,y1b2a1
Oh shit,y1b2a1
I sure hope not,y1b2a1
"Hopefully as soon as possible, but Finland and Sweden first, please!",y1b2a1
What happens if Ukraine joins? How does that change what’s happening on the ground since it would become a NATO vs NATO war all of the sudden?,y1b2a1
"It looks like they're in an upper floor office because of the windows and the lights shining through the curtains. I'm no expert but I would assume it's a pretty bad idea, more retarded than anything, to have all the top people of the Ukrainian Government or Armed Forces in one room during a time of war, especially when Russia doesn't give a fuck and is sending missiles every which way. Poland made the same stupid mistake when they loaded their entire government including the President on a ""russian"" built airplane that crashed in Russia in 2010. There are theories floating around Russia had something to do with it.",y1b2a1
Thought they applied months ago? Is turkey still stonewalling? Or was that in reference to Finland/Sweden?,y1b2a1
"I wonder IF Ukraine will accept loosing territory to Russia under the following conditions:

1) Recognized territorial lines are drawn along current battle lines or territorial lines that are similar

2) Ukraine joins NATO thus ensuring the remainder of Ukraine is never touched

3) NATO troops etc are not permitted to be stationed or to trained inside of Ukraine - only Ukrainian troops can be within Ukraine

4) No military exercises or deployments within 100km of any boarder - both sides must honour this

5) Residents of areas to be incorporated into Russia are allowed to freely emigrate to Ukraine for a period of 6 months - after which boarders will be erected and the militaries of both parties will withdraw from the boarder

I really don't think any of this would happen but this is a really dark path we are on globally.",y1b2a1
"Even when Ukraine defeats Russia and clear them out of their territory, Germany will block it because they’ll want to establish good economic relations with Russia again. They blocked it last time as it was.",y1b2a1
"Yes! I really hope so! Been thinking about this all Thanksgiving, really hope this is true!!",y1b2a1
Might as well...I don't think we can avoid the inevitable war.,y1b2a1
 🦃 will never let it happen…🤷🏾‍♂️,y1b2a1
"I hope they are denied until this war ends or a cease-fire is agreed on. They want to join now to get back up. Sure some think hell yea back them up but how many of them actually serve and will end up fighting? For most, it’s ok if someone else fights, but what about when their ass is on the line? They would be running for Canada just like in Vietnam.",y1b2a1
"Ukraine, welcome to NATO.",y1b2a1
Turkiye will be against it .. it wont be done i guess,y1b2a1

"this is what happens when you fire one general for not performing, assign the next one with the mandate of bringing some positive news to the home land, figure in a bid to prove his ambitions he goes to do what his predecessor couldn't manage, misreads the situation completely and orders his troops to go on the offensive with precious little resources his predecessor squandered away already. 

&#x200B;

you got fuck all in manpower, you got fuck all in equipment, but your glorious leader ordered you to bring succes to the mother land, so you get what little you have and make the same mistake as the five, six, seven or however many fucking generals putin has appointed and fired over the course of the past 7 months, and you tell your dudes to go forward. by any means. 

&#x200B;

they don't have tanks? fuck it, stick 'em in a bmp. they don't have those? fuck it, stick 'em in a btr. they don't have those? fuck it, stick 'em in a truck. they don't have artillery cover? fuck it, garden gnome wish dot com discount dictator ordered you to move forward and just squandered away half of the remaining long range precision weapons trying to take out a fucking childrens playground in kyiv instead of targeting military positions on the frontline, so you better pick up the slack and get going. the glorious russia can't be on the defensive in a war russia instigated, the propagandist on rossiya1 said so. remember them demanding heads should roll for the defeats suffered by the generals that came before you that did exactly the same shit as you're doing? better not dissapoint that lot and do as you're told. regardless of wether you can make it happen or not, you're not there for personal glory. you're there to be a scape goat. so get another 10k russians killed whilst you have a chance. hell, if they get killed in just the right way with a kilometer or 2 of territorial gains to show for it, maybe they'll make you a hero of the russian federation. you got nothing to lose but some minority groups and former prisoners, might aswell give it a shot.

"Putin will need to experience this kind of thing personally before he changes his ways. Until he sitting in a bunker with a loaded gun for suicide & bombs falling around him like Hitler faced in his final moments, the megalomaniac will not stop. In his sick mind, it's perfectly fine to murder millions if necessary to preserve his ""vulture's perch.""

"Russia has lost this war already, the question is only how much will they lose at the end.

They are enemies of the West and an enemy deserves no mercy, unless he surrenders his arms. It is not hypocritical, however, noone especially not some Petersburg gutter rat threatens every family around the world with nuclear destruction and won't be brought to heel for it.

Most Russians will have little memory, but about 40 to 50 percent will still vividly remember their last collapse in 1992 and they all surely aren't taught in school, that their 1917 collapse was induced by... Famine and 1 Mio men lost in the Brusilov offensive of 1916...

Their over 800k Covid Deaths, will further fuel Russias demise, their demography is terminal, their military impotent, their cash is running dry, their society and political system morally bancrupt, their consumer spending in collapse, their industry in collapse, their agriculture in decline and their Gas and Oil Business on the verge to lose its best market. Over 1000 companies left the country and over 500k young Russians left as well. They run out of spare parts and safe planes to use. This winter is not just gonna be hard for Europe, it is gonna be a long and hard winter for Putin's regime and his people as well... This isn't a nation losing a war, this is a nation whose institutions are falling apart.

Russia has poisoned the mind of its citizens, with horrendous manipulated reality propaganda.

Putin wanted this war? Those who bring the sword shall die by it.

War on all levels, economically, on the battlefield, info war, cyber war, you name it. Russia wanted to dance? We know their every weakness, we studied this nation for decades. The difference: America and its allies are like a demi-god in terms of military and economic might, compared to Russia.

Europe or America aren’t some sort of Hello Kitty party though, but mighty and old nations who have waged war with swords, when Russia was still a swampy bog.

War, famine, plague and death, Russia has called all 4 riders of the apocalypse to its evil empire. They have also invited the stablemaster: misinformation.

Russia wants to play hard ball? We haven’t even started yet, we have yet to behold the fireworks the mightiest military complex humanity has ever seen, can rain down on Russias army. They need to get ready, to stop a couple of thousand more HIMARS Rockets with their face. If they do not desist and leave Ukraine, next year around this time, Ukraine may already come at them with F16 Jets... This is an all in, The Western umbrella is at least 500 Billion Dollar invested itself, on this round of poker, this is gonna be either Russia and the rule of the jungle or the Western Alliance, democracy and the rules based order, I have a good feeling who is gonna collapse, and who is gonna stand in the remains of the rubble of Russias empire...
If Russia throws a nuke, this is their end as a Federation and as a state... Of course given the off chance the nukes of this corrupt nation even function, more likely they are gonna blow themselves up during launch... Especially Intel on their strategic arsenal and the level of maintenance is... Encouraging. So is this statement by an insider:

A former adviser to jailed Russian opposition leader Alexey Navalny and a defence analyst at Riddle think tank, Pavel Luzin suggests that Russia might not even be able to sustain its nuclear arsenal in the long term if it remains sanctioned.

ICBMs, SLBMs, and heavy bombers will be impossible to produce because of a lack of industrial equipment, technology, and human capital, Luzin said.

How many ppl. are there still, in these occupied regions of Donbass and Luhansk, that Russia claimed to wish to liberate?

Ukraine's pre-war population are refugees and another 1 million from the ""proRussian"" zones (mostly kids) have been kidnapped and deported to Siberia. If you want to cut a deal w Putin because he's now threatening nukes and you're scared, I get it.

But if you honestly believe Putin has any interest in any sane definition of the word ""peace"", you are fooling yourself.

Russia has genocided most of the male population of the area by now, in this useless attempt to win a battle against a foe far out of their league.

Ukraine is the sword, but this war is won by superior logistics, The Western alliance is the shield.

War is won by superior logistics, battles are won by soldiers.

Russia can go and try to destroy the missile factory in Arkansas... They can't do that? Oh too bad then... Russia cannot ever hope to win a war of attrition against the Western military complex.

The world has humored this fuel station, masquerading as a country for far too long. Russia will meet an enemy it cannot defeat: Time the great devourer of everything.

In a year from now, Russia is bancrupt at current burn rates of their rainy day funds, of 75 Billion Dollars every 100 days, its army will be in utter ruins, if they continue to lose an average of 4 tanks a day.

We have more important problems anyways, China for example.

This is the receiver of the message by the way... This isn't about Russia alone, they are a means to an end. The other real threat for US security and for the security of close allies such as Japan, South Korea and Taiwan is China. Russia is lucky, that the functionality of their arsenal is not 0, otherwise NATO would have marched on Moscow 7 months ago... Now the route to success is bancrupting Russia and starving their arsenal and industry of spare parts until it all comes crashing down.

How many has Russia, or Moscow for that matter, killed deported and maimed? Millions and tens of millions in the last 300 years of Russias colonialism? They have the audacity to point the finger at others as their own atrocities are just too sick to deal with.

Just watch and see, what is gonna happen to Russia over the the year 2023. Nations come and go, states collapse especially Russia has a proven to be prone to collapsing.

They cannot even produce most of their own wheel bearings for their cargo trains, ingredients for their medicine or their own commercial airplanes without western spare parts.

It is high Time to dissolve the remnants of this ossified, fascist colonial empire of evil.

The world is better off without the Russian Federation, Central Asia and the Caucausus will cherish the moment, this Moscovite scum is not ruling over them anymore.

It is a normal cycle: Nations and Empires have a dusk and a dawn... Russias end came in 1992, since then it exists at the mercy of the West, on life support, we tried to bring them into the order. They chose to go to war instead. This is the very last mistake, the last Tsar of Russia will ever make. This isn’t Russia losing a war, this is a nation that is failing.

It is time to put Russias imperial dreams to rest, and lift the burden of being a great power off their shoulders for all time...

Russia needs both: Western Imports, Know How and energy exports to Europe. Take that away and what remains is a half industrialized agrarian nation.

What can Russia offer: Oil, wheat and resources plus cyberterrorism.

Now they refuse to deliver even most of that, a nation that brings nothing to the temple, will take nothing from it as well.

Their end is geo-politically unavoidable, it is not a question of if but rather question of when.

Every Russian that can, should flee Russia, while this is still possible. The window of opportunity is hastening to a close.",y1crww

On the other hand, if Ukraine brings the war to Russia's (actual) territory, we risk Putin doing something really stupid (think tactical nukes, bioweapons, chemical weapons).

"Those ukrainian gay parades must be quite the thing, considering the kind of bodycounts they have inflicted.",y1jb8s
"And you know what's funny? That about 10-15 years ago the whole country (Russia) sang the songs of the gay singer Boris Moiseev (this is a famous Belarusian singer, rest in peace), because didn't care about his orientation, it was about his cool and incendiary songs. I sang his songs, there were even DVDs with his songs. It was a cool time, where people were kinder and were themselves. 

Edit: even some Ukrainians will remember his songs. I even remember the refrain of his song, sang all of Russia:

Где же ты, где Звездочка алая?

Где же ты, где искорка малая?

Где же ты, где чувство глубокое?

Счастье далекое где же ты, где?

Edit 2: Oh God, forgive me for the nostalgia, I also remembered that all of Russia sang the songs of Verka Serduchka (Andrey Danilko, this is a Ukrainian singer, he dressed as a woman for his stage image). And that was normal. Everyone loved him for his incendiary songs and concerts.

P.S For many years I thought that this was a real woman, and not a disguised man, only when the Internet appeared, I found out the truth. But I still love his incendiary songs with tears in my eyes.",y1jb8s

"It’s not great is it?  Surely everyone has heard of the life lesson that is exemplified by the statement, “don’t think of a pink elephant”.

"Ultramasculinists just feel good about themselves thinking on the rethoric of going into battle and then eliminating the enemy.

They get utterly confused and simply doesn't know what to do. Some of them will luckily desert and be arrested, the others will die.

That guy is very worried about being forced to be gay. Overcompensation maybe?,y1jb8s
"Yes we don't do it for land and resources and because Putin wants to be remembered as a great man and thought it would be easy, we do it for Godly reasons that's why all these Godly countries like North Korea are with us and other Christian persecuting countries including Islamic countries like the speaker in this video that thinks Jesus Christ is going to come back in the end times and just tell the Christians he's not God you mistakened because his Quran tells him that",y1jb8s

When you consider that the Stasi employees became unemployed overnight and, as traitors to the country, still had court hearings. They were unhappy because under Honecker they were respected and awesome. 💩

"Ukraine has done good shooting down most of the missiles, mainly using Soviet era systems.  With more modern Western AA coming on line hopefully they will do even better.  These are some of the last of Russia's precision missiles, it does not have an unlimited supply.  The Kaliber cruise missiles, at 6.5 million a unit, being routinely being shot down by Ukraine is not a good show for the Russians.  They can't keep it up much longer.",y1ljb5
Not bad but we need to help get it better,y1ljb5
"Hopefully this is true.  20 of 28 is good, but don’t forget.  Propaganda is used on all sides.  When the US bombed missile sites in Iran after it shelled a US base, Iran claimed to have intercepted all but 2 of the cruise missiles which we all know wasn’t true.  On the same note, the US said no casualties and minor injuries to soldiers when the base was shelled.  We found out later there were multiple injuries, some severe.  Hope ukraine is really intercepting them.  I really wish Israel would supply iron dome systems for Kyiv.  Israel always wants help from the world, but when the world needs their help they shy away.  If I was US POTUS I would be leaning strong on Israel to pony up for ukraine.",y1ljb5

The main plant has been destroyed, but repair companies can produce something. So Ukraine is slowly producing missiles for air defense. But probably they don't do it for the S-300, only smaller ones. And there is no data for these.",y1av5r

This is a nod to a popular travel show where the presenters hide a $100 note in whatever country they visited and the viewers who live in that city/area can go on a little quest. Guess this is the AFU’s version..,y1erjq

Uuhhhhh.........a vog grenade will scratch the paint on anything larger than a .50 cal. Top armor on most IFV is basically sheet metal. Barrels are an entirely different beast when it comes to steel quality and thickness.,y1glls

"The first guy brutally killed someone and should've been for 20+ years in prison. Now he lost his leg and get's a medal ""for bravery"", as well as presidential pardon. 

What a fucking irony. Murderer and criminal gets a medal in Russia. Way to go, Kremlin, way to go. I hope Russia will get destroyed very soon.",y1hb1y
"These guys came voluntary, consciensly, to fight and kill on Ukraine's ground.. They are not russian conscripts or other mobilized, forced to fight.
AFU are very generous with them.
Slava Ukrainia.",y1hb1y

"A medal for bravery, a special “I got injured” badge, a certificate from the director of national centre of defence of ruzzian federation, and last but not least - a signed document pardoning past crimes and a release document. All is forgiven boys, you’re fully rehabilitated and we know you won’t go back to crime. Enjoy your freedom. 

Only in russia convicts can get better treatment than professional soldiers. And this is of course purely for show to encourage others to join Wagner. They won’t tell you what they do to their own guys who don’t “rep the group correctly”. 

What a joke of a nation.

First guy was convicted of “murder with exceptional brutality”. Served 10 years, about half of his total sentence. He wonders if he exists for something else and not just to be punished. The training prior to going to Ukraine was brutal but no one died (during training) so it’s all good.

Second guy got 5 years for armed robbery. Rest is boring. I’m sure he won’t reoffend either. Oh and he did make a point that Wagner never send anyone to be cannon fodder (bro I’m not bluffing that’s why I gotta say it, cuz I’m not bluffing for real). 

Third guy got 5 years for violating section 162 of the criminal code, fairly sure this is armed robbery too. Blah blah blah Wagner have me 2nd life they are amazing, you get the idea.",y1hb1y
You lost your limbs.. but don’t you worry! we acknowledge that and give you this chunk of worthless metal and a handshake in return… now make sure to smile and say “thank you” ❤️☺️,y1hb1y

So he got that going for him.",y1j0tu
Well im sure he will be seen in a another video shortly. Filmed from an ukrainian drone perhaps. or from an atgm =),y1j0tu

The only rational outcome for Russia is to immediately stop the war, withdraw, overthrow the regime, hold democratic elections, fully cooperate with war crimes tribunals, pay reparations and so on.

"Hummm, we know by his actions and by his puppets mouths he wants a way out of the complete mess in Ukraine he created. His military is a total embarrassment and new equipment consists of drones made by another country and he is using his few parade weapons in occupied areas,. Your country's young and your brightest men have fled.  Putin will go down in  history as the man who destroyed his country and created the worst refugee influx in the world.",y1ajhv
"Could this be them looking for reasons to abandon Crimea? If suddenly by some miracle (i.e. Russians faking results like they do) everyone is in favor they can say ""look look, we do what the people want"" and can retreat without it looking like retreat.",y1ajhv
"Later the article will change:

Russians want to know how their citizens will perceive ~~such a defeat of~~   
~~the authorities and whether they are ready to defend Crimea.~~ that Putin and Kremlin totally devastated the Russian Ecomomy, destroyed the countrys military, and leaving them isolated from the rest of the world.",y1ajhv

1-He wants the pools to say that the Russians dont care about Crimea so they can give it up tu Ukraine without much repercussions.

2-He wants the pools to say people car about Crimea thus motivating another wave of mobilization.",y1ajhv

69420 is right around the corner,y12lmz
So in almost 8 months Russia has lost more troops than the US did in 15 years in Vietnam,y12lmz
"Remember, before the war, Russia only had 2850 functional tanks.",y12lmz
"63,000 seems a conservative number. I wonder how many wounded that made it back hospitals in Crimea or Russia died there or in route.",y12lmz
They cant have much left,y12lmz
Can anyone explain what the cruise missile loss means? Is this the amount shot down? Thanks,y12lmz
"Are there any estimates on Ukrainian losses, I'd imagine/hope that they'd be a lot less",y12lmz
I still think this should have a little cute bridge icon.,y12lmz
"Not a military dude asking some of you guys:   
""Are tanks even viable for war when 2 modern armys fight against each other?""  


Based on most videos on here, it looks like they are easy targets.",y12lmz
Putin's staggering disregard for human life,y12lmz
+46 cruise missiles wtf,y12lmz
"This is pure propaganda, why is it even allowed in here?",y12lmz
do u really believe these numbers?,y12lmz
"IMO these are nowhere near accurate, Ukrainian estimates are generally more than double NATO estimates. 

The last US estimate from early August was 20k killed, given the scale of the Kharkiv defeat I’d guess close to 30k by now. Still staggering, especially given Russia already had severe demographic issues before the war (low fertility, high emigration). Combined with the mass exodus of young, and generally highly educated people from the country…not a good outlook for the economy. 

On the plus side, the mail order bride industry is going to go bazongas with all the unmarried young women they’re going to have.",y12lmz
that is tons for 46 cruise missile,y12lmz
how many washing machines been killed tho,y12lmz
"But Russia said they only lost 6000 troops... That's why they had to mobilize 300,000 more men. 

Lolz How does anyone back in Russia believe anything they say anymore.",y12lmz
"I saw the other day that NATO estimates 80k Russian casualties. 

The United States lost 58k men during all of the Vietnam years.",y12lmz
Any chance to include ruzza POW's?,y12lmz
Love seeing these numbers 🙂.,y12lmz
"Assuming this list is spot on, and excluding the soldiers killed. What would one estimate the total dollar amount for the equipment lost by the Russians based on these figures???",y12lmz
Looks like Russia will just fight till it has nothing left! Then what?,y12lmz

Hey russian Army, you guys are peices of shit to putin and the rest of the world, as long as you let putin define you! He treats you like shit, makes sure you are armed, fed and treated like shit, so you must be be shit. Must Ukraine prove how putin is treating you? Nothing will change as long as putin keeps giving your country these crazy orders. Putin, his family and whomever he trusts tomorrow will be OK. Until you all realize he has lost his mind and ability for rational thought, the very people he ask to sacrifice themselves for his country, himself and his friends, will be the ones who pay the price to accomplish his goals, even as they change daily. Good luck with that if you all choose to do nothing about it!!!

Nothing has changed for us personally. When you see something like this, all conscious people have no doubt who can do it.

Only Russian can commit such acts of barbarities – throwing civilians including women into mass graves, – on the territory of Ukraine. Which was confirmed once again by this video.

P. S. Let's imagine how it will look in Russian shitty publics. Some of the dumb who posted yesterday's video will simply ignore today's. The others will write that «this is all a Ukrainian fake!».

Now with the threats of nuclear violence being proposed casually, normalized even. Tensions in Asia rising, food shortages, gas prices.

                           The difficulty in understanding the Russian is that we do not take cognizance of the fact that he is not a European, but an Asiatic, and therefore thinks deviously. We can no more understand a Russian than a Chinese or a Japanese, and from what I have seen of them, I have no particular desire to understand them except to ascertain how much lead or iron it takes to kill them.

"This is litteraly the work of Ukrainian Nazis in Kupiansk. They killed a bunch of pro-Russian people who worked with the Russian troops and administration. After the Russian troops left Kupiansk, Ukrainian Asov Regiment did this.

"i heard this missiles at 10am

so, no hot water at my home now

russians belive that we will surrender coz didnt have hot water? idiots",y0hfuy
"How come places like Kyiv haven't been supplied with Iron dome style anti missile systems?

Genuine question, Im sure there is good reason why and I just don't know it.",y0hfuy
I assume this will trigger significant deliveries of western air defense systems to Ukraine.,y0hfuy
Terroristic temper tantrum. Using cruise missiles for no strategic reason other than causing terror.  Fuck Putin.,y0hfuy
"The newly delivered 6 NASAMS systems shot down 41/75 Kalibr cruise missiles. MANPADS, and other anti air probably contributed but in the end a bunch got through. Not much one can do with 75 explosive missiles flying all at once. They are low and slow flying but as said, 75 of them is fucking ridicolous. What an absolute fucking nightmare.

&#x200B;

**Assuming Russia specifically used Kalibr cruise missiles which cost $6,500,000 each, they spent $488,000,000 USD equivalent doing this war crime bombing campaign. $488 million they could of used to build up their third world shithole country. People living 50 miles outside of Moscow literally shit in wooden outhouses and dig holes in the ground. No running water at many dacha's (homes) and no hot water. Yet they spent $488 MILLION to kill 10-20 civilians (no disrespect to the dead victims here, im just saying) and injure many more. Im betting not a single Ukrainian soldier, piece of equipment or otherwise was targeted.**

&#x200B;

And they are losing this war for many reasons but especially because they are using their GPS GUIDED, smart munitions bombing schools, playground and hospitals. Meanwhile the UAF is slowly but surely decimating their military and taking back land. 

&#x200B;

**THE MAN BEHIND this command to bomb is Sergei Surovikin, who oversaw the destruction of Aleppo, has taken charge of Putin’s forces in Ukraine. Days after taking command, this happens. CONNECT the DOTS. He NEEDS TO DIE**

&#x200B;

THIS DESPERATE WAR CRIME, THIS BOMBING RUN IS LITERALLY A REGIME ON ITS DEATH THROES. PUTIN IS DESPERATE and KNOWS he is losing. Terrorizing the Ukrainians into submission/defeat/surrender, but in the end bombing cities ONLY INCREASES resolve and morale for the victim country.",y0hfuy
The red white chimney is Kyiv  power plant ? So it looks like both missiles missed ?,y0hfuy
"I don't understand this. Is Russia incapable of guiding their cruise missiles? Is it a training issue, or weapon issue? They're getting absolutely fucked on the battle field. I can not wrap my head around sending a multi million dollar cruise missile in to a play ground vice targeting legitimate military targets. Call terrorist state all you want but it's just nonsense. Cruise missiles are without a doubt one of the most effective weapons and they're bombing street corners and play grounds and apartments. Is someone saying ""I want to fuck this ply ground up""? Or are their weapons such shit all they can do is ""hit this 10km square some where?",y0hfuy
And somehow pencil brained Putin thinks this makes him look 'strong.',y0hfuy
I always thought cms would be a smaller and faster than this. I feel like a decent air defense system would fix this problem fast.,y0hfuy
"I have nothing but hatred and pure disgust for Russia and its people.

What in the name of god do they think the win is here? Even if they destroy the entire country and its people, even if they rinse and repeat with all the old USSR states and rebuild the Soviet Union… then what? 

At this stage, they are global pariahs for the next century. Despised by a world who will want nothing to do with Russia. No trade, nothing.

The country is irreversibly doomed to die. Whether it’s this year or next decade, russia has sealed its own death warrant.",y0hfuy
41 of 75 missiles were intercepted according to Defense Ministry,y0hfuy
Obviously they have missiles for kyiv civilians and non for the frontline to protect canon fodders,y0hfuy
This is what cowardice and malice looks like. Putler and his crooks can’t leave this earth soon enough!,y0hfuy
"Seems like these strikes only hurt Russia even more. Wasting dozens of critical cruise missiles on random intersections, a playground, apartment buildings, a pedestrian bridge, etc. I would think from Russia’s point of view, they would have been better used on actual military targets, logistical targets, or other targets of strategic value vs just terrorizing civilians. Unless these are just misses. If so the accuracy of their cruise missile guidance is questionable. Either way makes them look completely incompetent.",y0hfuy
Need a shit ton more air defense.,y0hfuy
Russians can't win in the field so devolve to using cruise missiles that costs millions of dollars on Ukranain playgrounds. Russia is pathetic.,y0hfuy
Terror bombing civilians because their special bridge got hit. Pathetic.,y0hfuy
"Russians are terrorists, plain and simple, Russia is a terrorist state....",y0hfuy
Why doesn’t Ukraine fire missiles/rockets into downtown Moscow?  It is like 900 km.  I think it is about time.,y0hfuy
We need to give longer range missiles to Ukraine. The ruZzian need to stay feeling this war in the same way that Ukrainians have. Every attack on Ukrainian civilians should get the same response. 🖕🏼🇷🇺 The world is tired of their shit. Makes them pay. Sanctions aren't doing shit.

"I would have shit all over myself watching those missiles. The chances of them being nuclear in nature is so high. I’m glad they weren’t, and they were just a weird emotional response from Russia. Rest In Peace to the civilians who lost their lives in a meaningless attack.",y0hfuy
How the fuck can this be happening in the civilized west. Bombing civilian targets for revenge of a bridge. Russia is a terrorist state and should be treated like it.,y0hfuy
So I suppose that large power plant was the target but a hit on a civilian target half a mile away was good enough,y0hfuy
Fucking terrorists,y0hfuy
This is just sickening to watch.,y0hfuy
"Holy shit, that really is insane footage.",y0hfuy
This is how Vlad understands to show how small of a dick he has.,y0hfuy

"This are subsonic cruise missiles, they fly so slow even the most basic air defence would intercept them easily, especially at the final part when they climb at relatively high altitude to clear the random infrastructure slowing down even more. 

Providing Ukraine any medium range air defense systems would be enough to shoot them down.",y0hfuy
Terrorists with cruise missiles. Bullshit cowardice from the world's shittiest army!,y0hfuy
"Those orc cunts aren’t just inflicting terror on civilians, they’re depleting valuable smart missile systems they can’t replace.

I say. Take the war to Moscow.,y0hfuy
Shouldn't the Russians be focused on the Ukrainian offensive in the east/south instead of bombing innocent structures miles and miles away,y0hfuy
Why weren't the warning sirens going to alert people to seek shelter? 😞 I'm assuming it was very quick and unexpected?,y0hfuy
Burn Russia to the ground. Start with Moscow,y0hfuy

Russia is calling Ukraine a terrorist for blowing up a military’s strategic bridge and they are literally shooting missiles at purely civilian targets because they are so incompetent. Slava Ukraine 🇺🇦,y0hfuy

Crazy to see something hit a city like that. I would hope something like that couldn't happen in the west and our stationary systems would take care of anything like that with all our tax money we pay lol. I'm sure we can give Ukraine a couple systems or help set some up in the major city's.,y0hfuy

Do you thing those people that repeat propaganda nonsense feel at least a little stupid when looking at repairs of the bridge the claimed was already 100 percent daya ago ?,y0o7tx
That's gonna buff out :-),y0o7tx
"Notice the car bridge is also closed. 

It is certainly the part that was open for propaganda as it has the white and red crash barriers added, but not a single car is in sight.",y0o7tx
I hope they aren’t Russian to repair it anytime soon.,y0o7tx
"I at first was disappointed the rail bridge hadn’t also been destroyed, but as I keep watching video and see the damage that was cause, I’m realizing how much uncertainty there is about it, which I think would then be good for Ukraine. Russia’s options with the rail bridge are either demo a larger-than-necessary section of the bridge because of the uncertainty of the damage (which *could* be faster for repairing the damage) or take a longer time assessing the damage and only demo what was damaged",y0o7tx
A Russian hot wheels train....☠️☠️🤣🤣🤣🤣,y0o7tx
"Just like I THOUGHT..
The train tracks fuzes to the wheels..

Big time repairs . not to mention, the structural integrity of the concrete and rebar..

Neither way is THIS justification to launch cruise missiles at civilian population centers..

Fk putina and her ork disgraced army..

Slava 🇺🇦..

Glory to the heroes..

It's time to hit the bridge a SECOND TIME..

Muahhh putina..",y0o7tx
Nice of them to provide UA with a BDA,y0o7tx
Surely the railway track and that railway bridge is highly weakened after that fire,y0o7tx
"Track is easily replaced. This is not an issue. Did the heat penetrate the ballast (the gravel) and weaken the bridge below? What about all that fire on the sides of the bridge? Did that weaken the bridge? 

Track, though, is replaced just like paving a road after damage. Not a problem.",y0o7tx
"I gotta wonder how the footage got out.

apparently pudkins fan club has some dissenters who are willing to spread pudkins folly worldwide",y0o7tx
Those sagging rail truck axels looks like it got a tad warm,y0o7tx
"Those rails are fucked. It looks to be about 200 feet of rails that need to be replaced due to heat and stress damage, NOT including damage to bridge structure (needs an NDI).",y0o7tx
Didnt they said this would be back up and running in 24 hours after the blast? What a shocker that was a lie.,y0o7tx
I anticipate the guys that know about rail stuff will analyze this vid.,y0o7tx
"@ 15 seconds, there are no cars? I thought they ""fixed"" it.",y0o7tx
I could swear I saw a Russian video yesterday of a train moving down this track 🤔,y0o7tx
"I can't believe it, it actually melted the cast steel trucks!",y0o7tx
"So the “test train” that was sent along the tracks yesterday was a totally made up bullshit lie??? 

Who’d have thought it?",y0o7tx
Thanks for the recon!,y0o7tx
"They have done nothing. Not even cleared the destroyed cars. That will not be in operation anytime soon, given how efficient the Orcs are. Good for the Ukrainians, however, they managed this.",y0o7tx
Bomb it again plz and thank you.,y0o7tx
Can't fix that in a day,y0o7tx
I would strike if again in a different place free of civilians,y0o7tx
yeah I think its fucked up,y0o7tx
"No bueno, mon ami. No freaking bueno at all.",y0o7tx
Russia was in a real hurry to steal all the steel rolls from the Azov factory in Melitopol. Looks like they'll need much more.,y0o7tx
That remaining truck (carriage with wheels) must be welded to the tracks.,y0o7tx
Melted tracks. Beautiful.,y0o7tx
Didn't they say next day that the bridge is in operation and that trains are passing?,y0o7tx
Special operational train driver payments coming up..,y0o7tx
"""But fire can't melt steel.""
My bbq grill won't, but THAT kind of fire for that long will make steel sag, expand, buckle, rapidly rust, lost its temper and all sorts of fun things apart from what it does to concrete.",y0o7tx

"Lukashenko looks much more sad these days. Because he's between a rock and a hard place. He knows that Belarusian troops crossing one inch across the border to Ukraine seals his fate.

I highly recommend Kamil Kazani's twitter. He's a veritable oracle. 

Lukashenko really, really, really does not want his military to join this war. Because that would be the end. That would stamp his ticket for a helicopter to Russia, to live out his miserable last years in a shitty Moscow apartment. That is if the Russian hardliners don't just torture and kill him for having been a cocktease. 

His main goal really is to not have a war. Before 2020, he merely rented his soul to Russia when needed. In 2020 he was forced to sell his soul to Russia. Unsurprisingly, this has turned out to have been a very bad deal. He'd have gotten a nicer apartment in Moscow and a solid lease on life if he got on the chopper in 2020. 

Again, check out Kamil Kazani. Luka is a lot smarter than he looks. He's spent 30 years milking Russia for subsidies on the empty promise of Belarus eventually rejoining the Russian empire as a province. But no matter how smart and skilled the gambler, the house always wins in the end.",y0oq1w

This shit could be post on facepalm. Its so absurde XD this guy is such an idiot puppet.,y0oq1w
Imagine he is talking about Russia instead of Ukraine,y0oq1w

He’s putler’s foreskin.,y0oq1w
What on earth are these pajama generals writing down?,y0oq1w
"Loads of high raking well fed men taking notes, to look busy...

Who do you guys think has a smaller dick? Putin or Lukashenko?,y0oq1w
"Maybe he tells the truth? And by war he may mean not the existing one between Ukraine and Russia, but a potentially new one between Belarus and Russia. He also knows his army won’t be able to withstand Russia’s onslaught. He has no friends, no support from the outside. His army is smaller, poorly equipped and has dubious loyalty. Very much like Ukraine’s in 2014.

He may have overplayed his hand now. Both the Belorussians and Ukrainians will suffer from his folly.",y0oq1w
"I think you were in the first scrum, supporting the special operations. Are you saying you are a victim now?  Your hole is already dug deep. You are already in the doo doo...",y0oq1w
"Hes going to enter the war for sure - exactly the opposite of what he says. False flag will help but I think the decision has already been made. However, he has been bending over for Putin for years this shouldn't be surprising except that he knows hes a dead man no matter what.",y0oq1w
This only exacerbates Lukashenkos problems at home. If Poo-tina is weak then Lukashenko is weak. This is not what Lukashenko wanted but is being forced to do. Another escalation.🇺🇲🇺🇦,y0oq1w
"In February when almost no one gave any chance to the Ukrainians, almost no soldier from Belarus wanted to fight in this war and now when the Russians are literally looking at the battlefield in their rear view mirror this clown thinks he can send soldiers?!",y0oq1w
If Lukashenko invades Ukraine his life span will be about two weeks.,y0oq1w
"""Our main goal is to not have war, which is why we are deploying troops to the enemy""

or y'know, don't join an active war between two of your neighbors

boom, no war, incredible

they should make me president of belarus",y0oq1w
"Seriously, they have already provided their country as a staging ground for launching the initial invasion.  And that has gone not very according to plan. And now he wants to bring the fight home.  Didn’t Poland sign a mutual defense agreement recently with Ukraine. Would this open up Benito Lukashini for a open market or Poland assistance in government change?",y0oq1w
This guy needs to be overthrown. It will drive Putin even more crazy. The time is now.,y0oq1w
"So he is saying "" We do not want war, and because we don't want war 'We are going to war'"".

He is about as lucid as a cracked rock.",y0oq1w
How many bars does he own?,y0oq1w
"Serious question, If Belarus does attack Ukraine and then some of the Belarusian troops say fuck this I am going home or are forced to retreat in a battle.  What would be the reaction if Russian troops are used to stop them like is happening in occupied areas?  If Russians are used to kill their allies how long will they be allies?  Also if or when the majority of the population fights back against the regime do they have a chance?",y0oq1w

I wonder how the Belarus people will react to this,y0oq1w

*""Boss, have you read the reports coming outta Ukraine? I mean, the REAL reports? You sure we wanna tango with these motherfuckers?!?""*",y0oq1w

Belarus at this point would have a better chance of taking russia than Ukraine,y0oq1w

I wish that pootin puppet would eat a bullet already!,y0oq1w
Keep that up and you will have the good old usa at your door,y0oq1w

Lol how many think it sounds like he’s talking about Putin? Raise your hand.,y0oq1w
I want Poland to join in the fight and go invade Belarus,y0oq1w
Ha-tfu!,y0oq1w
So he declare war to Putin? I mean.. he is the one to drug them to war right?,y0oq1w
This guy is literally one missile away from being dragged out of his office and shot I the street by his own military.,y0oq1w
Time to load the nato troops on the polish side of the Belarusian border….they even think of moving into ukraine…we go to Minsk,y0oq1w
"""all kinds of scum who are trying to drag us into a fight""

Bold of him to speak of putin that way.",y0oq1w
Just imagine when this dinosaur disappears and a new west-leaning government gets to power in Belarus. Ukraine and Belarus can then join forces to permanently kick the fucking russians to the curb.,y0oq1w
I thought Belarus already attacked Ukraine in the beginning of this war? Did they pull their troops back shortly afterwards?,y0oq1w
"That's right. Put that noose around your neck. Let the Ukrainians take your measurements for the pine box. Oh, sorry. You don't deserve a pine box. 

You deserve being hog tied, thrown into a pit while naked with a bullet in your head. Maybe the Russian dildo will slow you down as you roll.",y0oq1w
"So they’ll go fight in ukraine, and say they are protecting their land 🤦🏼‍♂️",y0oq1w
I say he has be given an ultimatum on joining the WAR by Lil Putler. If you don't you die.,y0oq1w

He's lying. As usual.,y0oq1w
"He’s being very vague, maybe he will specify and turn his back of Putin?",y0oq1w
So are Russian troops going to guard the military of Belarus to keep them in thrall?,y0oq1w
"We, the military … can only hope that all good things will be good things. You go Luka! Dickwad!",y0oq1w
"All of his generals are taking notes:

""This guy is a dick.""

""I hate his kokbrush moustache.""

""Baldheaded ass hat.""

""I got a bullet for him, when the time comes.""

etc...",y0oq1w
"I'm sure Putin was like ""if you don't help me I will have you killed.""",y0oq1w
"Is it just me or does it seem like he’s posturing his military to fight against the Russians? Listen to his words. I’d love to see him ambush the Russian forces trying to force Belarus to go into the war with them. I know it’s likely wishful thinking and I know he’s an idiot, but, it’s likely most of his generals are not.",y0oq1w
He must've seen that Putin promote Kadyrov to Colonel General recently and he got jealous.,y0oq1w
So they must prepare for an attack by who? The Ukrainians would have no reason to attack. The only “scum” that would drag them into war is his buddy to the east.,y0oq1w
"This makes no sense. We have to prevent war but prepare for war because we don't want war...

I thought he’d shifted his focus to the potatoes.,y0oq1w
Delusions and a death wish,y0oq1w
"How accurate is the translation?

I only ask because if he really is trying to counteract the scum trying to drag him into a fight.

Then he can ONLY be referring to Putin, as Russia is the only one dragging Belarus into a war and Putin is undoubtedly scum.

Yeah I know probably too much thinking on my part.

You'd think Lukashenko would see the writing is on the wall for Russia, switch sides and cosy up to the West before it is too late.

No that's that overthinking again. Better stop.",y0oq1w
Kyiv in 3 days is it?,y0oq1w
"Putin knows calling for more conscripts will end up with a bullet to the back of his head.

I wonder if the bald wonder will get his General stars for this?",y0oq1w
Has he just landed on this planet? Ukraine doesn’t give a shit about Belarus. It is trying to fend off Nazis from Russia who want to steal its land and people,y0oq1w
"We want to kill other nations but we don't want to go on a war with them. 🤬
 You better be ready for it.",y0oq1w
"""all kinds of scum who are trying to drag us into a fight""

So stupid that it hurts.",y0oq1w
"do they all have the same uniform manufacturer, because the Belarusian and North Korean uniforms look identical, plus their stupidly high caps they rock.",y0oq1w
"Bring it, asshole.",y0oq1w
"Is there a place we can post or write to, that is guaranteed this guy would see it? I think it’s important he hears that the world knows he’s a loser cunt, and nothing more than a bullet sponge for Putin.",y0oq1w
"If he wants to avoid getting dragged into a war, he should look East, not South.

Winter is coming...",y0oq1w
Is he giving a speech or giving a class. What’s with the audience taking note ? I am always surprised at the lack of sophistication that Russian and Belarusians put out.,y0oq1w
Diligently writing down “No war” 😂,y0oq1w
"These people are so fucking delusional and evil. To justify sending Belarusians to war, he’s just straight up lying to his people, acting as if Ukraine is dragging them into the war! There’s no amount of mental gymnastics one can perform in order to justify sending troops to kill and die in Ukraine. YOU involved YOUR OWN COUNTRY, by allowing Russia to station their troops along your border, and allowing them to utilize your country as a logistical hub, and to shoot off missiles from your country and into Ukraine. Why would Ukraine WANT TO drag you into this war?! They already have enough problems fighting off the orcs, and if anything, they have exercised a whole lot of restraint by not targeting Belarus more and taking out ammunition depots, troops, etc. YOU have been involving your own country in this senseless war, to appease your master, Putin. Sadly, I’m sure a huge portion of the Belarusian population is buying into these lies, and are so brainwashed by propaganda, they are totally supportive of sending their own men and women to fight alongside Russia. Many of them will just accept everything Lukashenko is saying, and believe that their country is being threatened, and Ukraine is sucking them into this war. Unfortunately, many people are sooo blinded by their ultra nationalist views, that regardless of how obviously wrong they are, they will somehow justify their heinous actions and vow allegiance to Putin and Lukashenko under the guise of patriotism, and they will buy into all of the rhetoric their dictators spew. No one was going to attack Belarus! Ukraine wasn’t going to invade Russia! This war is absolutely senseless! Someone really needs to take out Putin and Lukashenko ASAP!",y0oq1w
Self-proclaimed dictator*,y0oq1w
Russia shouldve just tried to annex these knobheads,y0oq1w
If war was to spil into Belarus he knows that the people would not back him up. They would side with the Ukraine and he would be shot against a wall. He's fucking scared and should be!,y0oq1w
This FSB asset and a traitor for his people will be in the mud of the history,y0oq1w
"How easy would it be to smoke this fool lol.. I mean Putins biggest ally out of the picture, things will get challenging real quick..",y0oq1w
I’m willing to be I can smack this dude one to one and have him scream “Slava Ukraini”!,y0oq1w
Just kill thiz papa-naza,y0oq1w
What if Lukashenko double crosses Russia & starts helping Ukraine?,y0oq1w
Hoping to divert Ukraine forces and relieve pressure in the East.,y0oq1w

Good plan.  Add enough of these and the vehicle will get so heavy its suspension and drive train will break on the way to battle.  Also the extra weight will really help it get through those mud holes that the rains are creating.  Either way you do not make it to battle and live after running away bravely.

Smells like desperation.,y0807p
Again and again russia embarrasses them selves. What a petty pathetic leadership,y0807p
God they are pathetic,y0807p
"Did I understand correctly, they missed?? 😁😅😂😂",y0807p
"It missed its target, what a surprise… story of the war so far really as isn’t it.
Ukraine hits a legitimate target, critical for the war effort with a good degree of accuracy.
Russia responds out of spite, attacking civilian infrastructure and misses the intended target due to incompetence.

Slow clap for Russia",y0807p
"These long range missiles would have been used to hit strategic targets if used by Ukrainians.

With such blows the RU Army shows, once again, that it is not only a terror entity, but also deeply incompetent.",y0807p

The best thing about this is that they even missed .,y0807p

It’s like in the Bible…",y0807p
That’s the same bridge that was protected by a solitary volunteer at the beginning of the war. I remember it well,y0807p
Did they just fail to blow up a... glass bridge? There guys never cease to amaze me,y0807p

"As much as I hurt for the Ukrainians when I see these revenge type missile attacks, part of me is still glad that the Russians are wasting their PGMs on non-military targets. They're going to regret that..",y0807p
"Okay, I understand this bridge is important to Ukrainians and those in Kyiv but, objectively, this is hilarious. 

Not because Russia attacked a bridge and damaged it. But because Ukraine dealt an absolutely devastating blow to the Russian military in Crimea by destroying what is essentially their only lifeline. Their only way to move supplies and vehicles and troops into Crimea to continue waging Putin's unjust war, with the icing on the cake being the attack occurred on Putin's birthday. Then Russia responds with... This.

They attacked a pedestrian bridge in Kyiv with absolutely zero military value, and they didn't even do it successfully. 

Russia, and particularly Putin, is such a fuckin joke. Absolutely pathetic.",y0807p
Russia is a terrorist country . Ukraine is winning the war.,y0807p
Lol they missed. Typical Russia.,y0807p
Bridge made out of glass withstands attack better than 17 layer protected Ruzzian bridge,y0807p
So what is this? Bridge wars now? This is just petty.,y0807p
"Lmao imagine being in charge of Russian military strategy and deciding that a pedestrian bridge was a good target to spend your missiles on, like what are they thinking? Are their intelligence so bad that they genuinely think this is the best use of hundreds of millions of dollars of missiles? Utter morons that is only pushing Russia to the brink of collapse, failed terrorist state.

Slava Ukraini brothers, we will win this together.",y0807p
"Putin: Those damn Ukrainians hit my bridge! I want you to hit the best looking bridge in all of Kyiv!

Soldier: Sir does it matter if it’s a footbridge?

Putin: I said their best looking bridge!

Soldier: Sir I think our missiles cost more than the damage it will cause…

Putin: Do you want to fall out of a window soldier?!

Soldier: *shrugs and fires expensive missile*",y0807p
That looked like it did no damage whatsoever.,y0807p
Can I just point out that this bridge is made of glass and is still standing......umm....go Russia?,y0807p

"Now it’s enough. Nato, EU and Ukraine need to finish Russia now when they are week. There Nukes are probably in the same bad rotten shape as there military over all. If we don’t deal with these Russian facists it will just get worse. Think like we have the chance to stop Nazi Germany in 1939. We also have control over there  nuclear weapons facilities. If they move we blow them to the moon. It’s time to cleanse Russia from there evil government from hell and free the Russian people. We can do the same with Russia as we did with Berlin in 1946 but with out the communist. After Putin and the rest of kremlin has been sentenced to death in Haag we take care of Russia. We could try to make a democratic country",y0807p

"In the 1970’s, nuclear scientists created the neutron bomb. A powerful weapon that decimated city populations while leaving buildings standing. The weapon could fit into a briefcase or in today’s simple backpack. https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suitcase_nuclear_device",y0807p
"Russians are cringe. At the macro political stage the entire nation acts exactly like every Russian prole I have met:

They start some kind of really stupid trouble for reasons that make no sense except, maybe, to them. Then they refuse to back down and make everything worse by insisting with nonsense talk, repeatedly missing every offered opportunity at resolvong the issue, instead worsening the aituation every time. When things inevitably go wrong, their bullshit intensifies as if lying hard enough would make the absurd somehow real. They lie, even if they know you know that they know. Political scientists may see this as the social characteristics of authoritarian societies and they might be right, but it is also a characteristic of the people and their culture. The most pathetic thing about Russians is that they are INCRE-HE-DIBLY petty in these situations. Can't win a war? Bomb civilians, they had it coming. Serves them well for not submitting to our greatness. Exterminate them and their culture for resisisting extermination of their people and culture. SS sercivemen expressed similar sentiments in their diaries. They were honestly personally upset the Russians would resist. I say authoritarian people are made dumb and dangerous by their ideology. They are petty and pathetic when powerless and infinetely sadistic when they have power. The SS would have reacted like the Russians: Strike at some civilian bridge and pretend you are stronk and have reigned proper retribution. Nevermind the fact we all perceive the impotent pettyness of their actions. It gains them nothing, it hampers their war effort. What did the murder of civilians - in the mind of the petty sadistic Russian murderers no doubt a legitimate act of punishment for some transgression - achieve for the Russian war effort? What did the holocaust achieve for the Nazis? Or the rape of Belgium for the German Kaiserreich? Nothing but to lay bare to the world their failure as civilized people and to galvanize support for their victims.",y0807p

This is Sarah Ashton-Cirillo. Prior to all this she was in Las Vegas and Florida (and still comments on Vegas politics from time to time). Nobody seemed upset by this sort of practice until the transgender reporter did it, and she doesn't seem to be on tik-tok, that's just trolling.

She's been in Kharkiv for most of the war even as that city has been bombed more days than not. She was in Bhakmut last week as the Wagner Nazi Russians pushed hard to take the town.

The not the greatest reporter - a bit less objective than many and much of her reporting is just relaying what she's seeing around her. But she's one of the most consistently in the thick of it English-speaking reporters.

And much like Malcom Nance, she can't help but become part of the story. Russia and its willing idiots continually push the line that Ukraine is Nazi, run by Nazis, supportive of Nazis. So Ashton-Cirillo's and Nance's experiences stand in contrast to that, as they are accepted by the local populations. Real Nazis, after all, would kill either one of them for being who they are, along with Ukraine's Jewish president.

"This is the difference between western/American military action and that of Russia. Western ethos is to avoid civilian casualties. Massive amounts of effort is expended to avoid civilian casualties.

Unfortunately, innocent people still die.

The above though is Russian military policy. They are happy to target and kill civilians. Russia is a terrorist state.",y0abfl

"Her name is [Sarah Ashton-Cirillo](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sarah_Ashton-Cirillo), and she's not doing this for TikTok likes.  In this world where many people are doom scrolling other peoples'  filtered lifestyles, the harshness of reality may be a surprise to you.

Sarah is not identifying the person, in any way, she's reporting a war crime, and with genuine distress at having to do this.

Before I give up on all the dickheads saying that this is disrespectful and that this is done for tiktok or some shit,  She's actually far braver than most people on this thread.

[Meet the trans war correspondent at Ukraine’s frontlines](https://xtramagazine.com/power/trans-war-correspondent-sarah-ashton-cirillo-ukraine-227220)

People are becoming so indoctrinated by doom scrolling filtered lifestyles on social media that they instantly think that a video is only done for the likes.

She's showing reality, unfiltered.  And is in the thick of it (she spent most of her time there in Kherson, and it seems only travelled to Kyiv to report on this horrific shit, it's why she quickly corrects the place she's at).

I don't know Sarah, but I wanted to find out more about her after all the comments saying that this is 'disgusting' and only for likes, when what I could see and hear in her reporting was genuine distress.

Btw, reporters usually have their face in the things they're reporting first hand, but the camera is usually held by someone else, so I understand your confusion between reporting news and those funny influencer vids where they hold the camera themselves.  Damn, she should've used a selfie stick and a gimbal to make it more professional, I guess that wasn't on her mind at the time",y0abfl
"This must end, unbelieveable what the world tolerates... what the west tolerates.  
Putin doesnt care who dies and how many die. Its time to give ukraine whats needed and to shoot back into russia.  
Then people will learn what suffering means and when they will get active.  
As long as russians feel safe in russia, theres no reason for them to go against putin.  
Why would they even care about the russian military comiting a genocide, they just can close their eyes and pretend the world is a wonderful peaceful place.",y0abfl
"I think Russia's attacks against civillians in the early stages of the war was trying to horrify and get Ukraine to give up. Now I think Russia is actually trying to bait Ukraine to respond with civillian attacks against targets in Russia. This would give Russia cover to use nuclear weapons and/or (in Putins view, hopefully) rally Russian people.",y0abfl

I’m sure it is also how they begin every other video they film, so it is very much a habit. Arguments can be made for and against showing this poor unlucky individual (as opposed to blurring). On one hand, the disgusting reality of war must be documented. On the other, this person is no longer able to consent to being broadcast to the internet.",y0abfl

"Wow.  That is nuts.

Russia is going to be throwing a temper tantrum with the limited missiles they have left.  Ukrainian citizens need to avoid densely populated areas for the next few days and try to bunker down.

Luckily Russia is making a strategic mistake here by wasting their cruise missiles on Ukrainian civilians,  who have already proven to be more courageous than anybody I've seen in recent memory (the Iranian teenage girls deserve a shout-out).  Each one of these wildly launched cruise missiles is one less destroyed strategic target, Ukraine's brave civilians are inadvertently helping their military.

It's the final round and Russian Drago is hurt and swinging wildly, but he doesn't have much left in the tank.  Ukrainian Rocky just needs to stay brave a little bit longer and take the punches.  The knockout blow is coming and this movie will be over soon.",y08hc7

I’m hoping all these rounds are donated by Russia.  Other wise what a waist.  I’d think conventional artillery would be cheaper and more accurate.   I guess if these choppers can’t get in close enough to use the weapon systems as intended then firing and maybe hitting something is better than not firing at all?,y0g37i
So how come everyone is worried about how much this costs? It’s war and it’s an unlimited budget.,y0g37i
"Yes they are unguided but is decently accurate if calculated correctly but the issue is the Russians with their mi 35 ka-50 and ka 52s have a automatic calculation system on their hud and multifunction displays which make the process extremely accurate and effective.
Common misconception is that modern Russian aircraft are bad they are not they are quite good better then Chinese aircraft I would say. They are just used by undertrained crews. For example the su 35 is a masterpiece.

"If the Russians are attacking playgrounds instead of military targets, then this war is going worse for them then it appears.  The Russian army doesn't have this kind of weaponry to waste on attacking Kyiv.  I get tit for tat (game theory) so the politics make sense (not sure about military sense), but the Russians are losing this war (thankfully).

I hope that the Ukrainians persevere and repel the Russians off their land.  What the Russian Federation Army has done to Ukrainian civilians in this war is atrocious.  This attack seems more of the same.  Attack civilian targets instead of military one must be some kind of Russian Army logic.  I just don't understand.",y07p4t

It's insane that people, non-russian and otherwise, still support this sht AND advocate for more russian attacks! Like, fck it at this point, the russian populace has clearly demonstarted it's inability and lack of interest in thinking for themselves, stacked on with mass censorship from RosComNadzor (RusCommunicationOverwatch, what a pretentious fcking name, too), but... people in the most well-off countries on earth with access to almost every website and news source on the PLANET still support them, somehow?",y088e1

This is clearly a stated sim from the leadership that enables and allows massive systemic and widespread crimes against humanity and war crimes to be committed that are collectively genocide. This comes from the top.

Wake up the World. This is genocide in action and it’s not being stopped.

Wake up UN. UNGA needs to debate Genocide in Ukraine and hold Russia responsible, recognise this as genocide and demand action far more than is currently being taken.",y088e1

"I think it has to be recognized that the most fervent believers are going to be the ones responding positively on social media.  I am Canadian and our own far right movements are the exact same - extremely loud far beyond their size and they say the most idiotic and despicable things on social media.  We see this repeated in many places and it is the case in Russia.

The tables will turn when the Russians you see posting on Telegram themselves become the victims.  And there is as good a chance they will become victims of their own govt vs any foreign retribution.  

We also have to take into account that a vast number of the users on telegram are effectively Kremlin ""bots"" - controlled and manipulated accounts whose job is to push and amplify the message.  My professional work delves into this area and our internal assessments are that a substantial portion of russian telegram traffic is ""fake"" - in other words it is controlled and directed traffic not traffic that is originating from a normal person just going about their lives and using Telegram Messenger as a social media outlet for communications between they and their friends.

None of my points have anything to do with the reprehensibility of Russia's actions and the support such actions do have in some segments of the Russian population.  Rather just that we be aware we are viewing an extremely manipulated environment and much if not most of what we are seeing in chat traffic is manipulated.  Russian leadership clearly wants to build an image that its actions enjoy widespread public support and what we are observing is one means to that goal.

Determining the real level of support for Putler and his actions is more difficult.  We can gauge by the revolts in some places to conscription, those fleeing Russia, the acts of sabotage throughout the country.  This does tell us that its not all roses and cake.  Sadly I do doubt it is enough to overcome the control apparatus that exists in Russia.",y088e1

Now is the chance for Belarusians to revolt against the regime. The security services will be a bit distracted.,y0b99d
What an elaborate way of Belarus to donate hardware to Ukraine.,y0b99d
"So it begins... Again.

Ukraine blasting northen bridges makes more sense, they knew belarus will do a move on the norther front. 
I Hope that will all the months Ukraine had they managed to set up a lot of welcoming stuff for belarus.",y0b99d
This is actually a perfect time to push for a revolt in Belarus. The people don't support the Ukrainian invasion. They have seen what Russia is doing and are seeing the country becoming more and more isolated. This would be very risky for Lukafuckface to do. Imagine if Belarus revolted and turned into an enemy against Russia,y0b99d
"The last gasps of the former Soviet Union. 

Lukashenko knows that when Putin goes down, so will he. Lukashenko knows that Putin and Russia are losing badly. This entry into war is clearly not something he wanted to do, as evidenced by him only entering the war officially after nearly eight months since the start. 

My guess is the Belarus military gets badly embarrassed, targets in Belarus get destroyed, and the country becomes destabilized and riotous, and it all happens within weeks. 

This is the next step in the last chapter. I'm looking forward.",y0b99d
Under equiped belarusian conscripts vs 7 months nato equiped battle hardened angro ukrainians ![gif](emote|free_emotes_pack|joy) good luck ladies you are going to need a lot of it,y0b99d
I hope that the belarussian people will show more balls and spine than the russians and actually rise against the regime and remove that carnival clown from office,y0b99d
Attacking defense positions just in time for winter. Putin and fat man lacking in strategy,y0b99d
"The pressure from Russia on Lukanhesko to open a second front has to be enormous.  Russia is grasping at anything.  

Belarus has to be paying attention to the fact that a very strong Russian attack in February was stopped by unprepared, unmobilized Ukrainian forces.  And that attack was spearheaded by Russia’s most elite forces. 

Ukraine now is expecting an attack; has already planned, trained, and rehearsed its operations in response; and already has forces allocated to that operation.  

Belarus won’t have the luxury of just driving across the border for several hours before a Ukrainian response. They will face immediate, debilitating opposition just getting out of their assembly areas. 

It is an entirely different Ukrainian defense against a Belorussian military that is not even as modernized or capable as the current depleted Russian army.",y0b99d
"Yeah, Russia, the big bad second army in the world got their ass handed to them, obviously Belarus is the real threat /s",y0b99d
This child might be even dumber than putler...,y0b99d
He just gagged on Putin’s tiny cock. Fucking kill that cunt too.,y0b99d
"https://www.reuters.com/world/ says [Lukaschenko] ‘had ordered troops to deploy with Russian forces near Ukraine in response to what he said was a clear threat to Belarus from Kyiv and its backers in the West’ I doubt Belarusian troops will come over the border but this might be an excuse for (more) cross-border artillery, missile and air strikes…?",y0b99d
"He's not gonna do anything significant. He knows one he tries the army is gonna Revolt nobody in Belarus wants to play fertillizer in Ukraine for uncle Luka and Putl er. Also northern Ukraine is ready and waiting for them and in comparison to february this planned ""invasion"" won't have nearly the capability the original one had. It's gonna piss of the ukranians even more and well i have not very high hopes for anything involving pissed off ukranians because they will destroy any invaders for sure.",y0b99d
"A lot, I mean, a lot of people are waiting for a chance to free Belarus from this despicable regime and he just joined Putin like ""Hey, y'all! The target got bigger! Don't miss the opportunity! Get rid of two for for the price of one!""",y0b99d
Poland should set up a false flag operation and shove a stick up Lukasheenko's ass with a cross border assault strait to Minsk. You'll see Putin run with his tail between his legs thinking NATO is now directly involved. Belarus is a minion state that Russia will never support. Now is the time for bold moves.,y0b99d
"How much can Belarus really commit? Article says the military is only 60,000 strong. That’s not a whole lot.",y0b99d
Let Poland join in as well to make is a 2 vs 2,y0b99d
One toe over the border and ukraine will destroy them all,y0b99d

"Gotta love how delusional Lukashenko is. No one cares if Belarus joins Russia. Ukraine will eliminate their Army too. Kind of a 2 birds one stone scenario here. 

Also, maybe NATO will become more directly involved and crush Russia and Belarus once and for all!",y0b99d
More bullet sponges.,y0b99d
"Time for the old Gaddafi goodbye. Hang the weaselling cunt from a lamp post, Belarus.",y0b99d
"Sure hope he hand picked those soldiers for their loyalty, cause if not, there might be a lot of freindly fire accidents between russians and Belarusians.",y0b99d
And we all saw that coming.,y0b99d
"Probably wishful thinking on my part, but maybe this is Putin’s out. He gets Belarus involved and when they suffer the same fate as Russia, or worse, he’ll have a scapegoat to blame the poor performance on. Hell, maybe the Belarusian army turns on the Russian army and this all ends sooner rather than later.",y0b99d
Putler needs help he's desperate. Both dictators are going down,y0b99d
"So if Belarus attacks with Russian soldiers or allows a attacks to take place from their soil (which they have done already), then I think the world has to act decisively with air strikes against the the invading forces.  

This is easy to say, but the world can not sit by and see this insanity escalate.  The Ukrainian people need the world's help.  We can not depend on these brave people to defend the world from Russian aggression.",y0b99d
The beginning of the end of that fat wanker,y0b99d
So now we're going to see Belarusian corpses lying in the mud with Orcs?,y0b99d
"Yeah! Send more fodder canyon, Ukrainians are running out of targets",y0b99d
"And the west will just look at it happening, doing barely anything because they are afraid that Putain will be angry if they do anything that would harm Russia directly.",y0b99d
"🤣🤣🤣 That tubby cunt doesn’t know what’s he doing, Ukrainians about to feast on these",y0b99d
Fuck them,y0b99d
Lukashenko is gonna be sorry.,y0b99d
"You have achieved your article limit lol, kiss my ass.",y0b99d
So they can actually go after Russian bombers in Belarusian airspace shooting cruise missiles?,y0b99d
Let's hope the civilian uprising starts here in Belarus and let's hope enough Russians can witness this and bring it back to Moscow. My heart goes out to the people of Ukraine.,y0b99d
"My guess they’ll wait at the border to try and peel Ukrainians away from the eastern front. If they set foot on Ukraine, it’ll be a meat grinder for Belorussian troops who’ll more than likely turn tail and run, or decide surrender in Ukraine is a better life than hobbling around back home.",y0b99d
Puppet,y0b99d
Belarus about to find out,y0b99d
It’s almost over. One last bang and 2 new countries with another 2 dead dictators,y0b99d

"Bring it, Bitch! Honestly, I struggle to figure out why Nancy Lukashitko has been getting a pass for this long?",y0b99d
This means NATO now can deploy?,y0b99d
Meat grinder is hungry,y0b99d

When some farmer's family gets blown up from a grad rocket in a tiny village we won't have pictures. Putin needs to lose this war and he needs to lose it hard.

"So it's the moskva excuse again? ""They did not destroy it, we just fucked up ourselves""",y0fan0
Russian Bridge fucked itself,y0fan0
"I find this plausible. Truck carrying poorly packed ammunition hits bump? I wouldn’t bet lots of money on the possibility, but they really do suck at so many things.",y0fan0
"Either way though it looks bad for Russia. They can’t protect their shitty bridge from attack (if Ukraine did it), yet their personnel are so poorly trained, and have an average IQ of true 0 that they blow their own shit up (if Ukraine didn’t do it). 

I mean pick one, Russia. But both make you look incompetent.",y0fan0
"If true, they're really sooooo bad at logistics 🤦‍♂️",y0fan0
Are we using MSN as a creditable source now days?,y0fan0
It was most likely the lorry that exploded using fertiliser and petrol as the blast was a fireball which is common in VBIED blasts while high explosive blasts found on missiles and military bombs are more smoke filled... I wrote an essay detailing all the different kinds of explosives and how explosives react under different conditions but this subreddit doesn't allow me to link other subreddits so I will leave you with this [clip](https://www.military.com/video/operations-and-strategy/terrorism/rebels-blast-checkpoint-rc-vbied/3226576099001) which mirrors the explosion on the bridge.,y0fan0
"Well I was wondering how they managed to assemble such a powerful bomb and drive it through security in enemy territory. Was the truck traveling to or from Russia? I have been assuming it was going towards Russia.

It would be quite a coincidence for it to explode next to the train. Isn’t the rail bridge arguably more valuable for moving military supplies?",y0fan0
It is better if it was caused by their own incompetence.  Why are yall so fast to credit Ukraine with this?  There is real value in exploring this possibility.,y0fan0
Like no fact supporting it was Ukrainian specop or even track blast to start with.,y0fan0
My bet is that ucranians took advantage of explosives already planted by russians as a security measure to blow the bridge in case of danger. By planting a secondary trigger device or hacking the previous russian electronic one. Too much explosives to be installed and stay unnoticed.,y0fan0
Yeah sure. Cigarette drop etc. We all know how lazy ruzzians are with work safety. So they have to punish Ukraine for their safety failures.,y0fan0
But an Explosion at the Same time a fuel tank train is next to the truck isnt luck... This is a timed Attack... They probably wanted to Hit the train but missed....,y0fan0
False flag? (Again),y0fan0
Cigs,y0fan0
The Russian incompetence… they have zero control over the situation.,y0fan0
That kinda makes sense imagine a mine blowing up in the back of a packed semi right as it was about to go uphill it blows. The only question I have is why would they be taking arms opposite of Crimea? Tricky for sure.,y0fan0
"but could have been Russians themselves moving explosives

thats what i was saying on that day:

1. Russian military truck was checked and got permission to cross the bridge ,
2. the truck exploded somehow - most likely  was shot from another car from the front , or had a time  bomb planted under it",y0fan0
“Speculation” being the key word here. He also has no clue as to the real cause.,y0fan0
"If any army is inept enough to blow up their own infrastructure, it’s the idiot Russians.",y0fan0
If this was a truck bomb then jeffrey epstein did kill himself,y0fan0
🤔 ... 🙄🙂😂🤣😘😉 ... (🤣),y0fan0
"Who cares, don’t tell us, AND keep the ruzzians guessing, and do it as many times as it takes to collapse that bridge.",y0fan0
Explosion came from under the bridge and any truck theory is a way for Russians to cover their incompetence in protecting their “symbol “,y0fan0
Russia is the only big country incompetent enough toe make claims like this believable,y0fan0
"A truck bomb is just ludicrous, for any expert to suggest it isn't an expert.",y0fan0

"Really interesting article. Tx for posting.

I did not know much about her and had not really given much thought to her origin.

Comedy Central should air this show every week.,y04rgf
"People here are missing the point... his opening lines of why do we need them.. we can cut them off, is purely positioning the local populace into thinking Russia is doing the isolation from a position of strength and because of western weakness. When in truth it’s being done by the west TO the Russians and they can’t stop it.  Their propaganda machine poring scorn on the enemy, whilst signalling their perceived strength is the Russian way and it’s the only coping mechanism for their regime and culture to survive the sanctions and economic chaos.  Normally they would crow about their great army but that is obviously a fallacy now so they revert to great motherland and Russian cultural strength.

Sadly..
The point he's getting at is "" nuclear weapons being used in Ukraine""..
This madness needs to STOP..
This 🐷 thinks that by dropping nukes on Ukraine's population/army, ppl will flee into Europe.
What THIS FUKIN psychopath fails to realize that, nuclear escalations mean the end of russia..
The refugees will be mostly russian.. Running for THEIR LIVES bcuz of fear of retribution..which, by the way, will be instantaneous and coordination will be global against THIS terrorist State..

Bar the children of these asshats from attending western universities.  Prohibit wealthy Russians from buying real estate in Europe and just keep their country cut off from international banking system.  Let them see how well self financing their economy goes in a kleptocracy.   

The west never needed Russia; the Cold War era showed that. For 30 years Europe tried to draw Russia into the modern world.  It’s clear Russia still isn’t ready to join the end of the 20th century yet.",y04rgf

Say the people who caused a massive exodus amongst their own population.,y04rgf
"So now they are brazenly stating that they should again use refugees as a weapon of war thereby repeating the human horror perpetrated by Assad and Russia in Syria. 

Although the inhumane depths Russia is willing to sink seemingly knows no bounds, they are at least putting most of the appeasement simps back in their box.

"This is all so weird to see. It is as if Putin has elected to put up a gigantic grindstone for the Russian people and we are witnessing a messy and unfortunately dangerous reincarnation of the ""long march"", only that Mao is sitting safely in a bunker somewhere.

Like, by now it appears as if this whole conflict has not so much become a conquest as a depopulation effort for Russia's minorities and working class ( not to mention the brain-drain ).

The mental gymnastics required to view this sorry affair as a rebuilding/shaping of a ""great Russian Nation/Empire"" must be absolutely mind-boggling.

Even if by pure projected-violence alone Putin succeeds in his conquests: just imagine a prospect future ""Novo-Russian"" realizing that this is how their ""country"" was built - on the backs of drunk and oblivious people who treated each other with little more empathy, honesty and respect than what they could muster for livestock.

Absolutely bonkers.",y02ga9

ruskies and their bullshit reply. All they know is to lob random shit and say they're winning,y076bf
"There is a thing that I learned from others talking about Russia.

Russia wins wars not by conquest but by making the other side surrender. I know this might sound stupid but their tactic is to terrorise the other side into surrendering. They will attack the civilians so the other side of the war will after some time consider surrendering and making some concessions because they are losing so many of them.

Terrorist style of warfare if you want this summarised in few words. This is sad but not shocking or surprising to me.",y076bf
ATACMS time?,y076bf
We used to think there's always a complex and twisted ruse behing each and every move of the russian regime. Now we know the chess-master-in-chief systematically chooses to throw a tantrum and flip over the board when he starts loosing the game...,y076bf
It is pretty clear that Ukraine should take this fight not only to the borders with Russia but also to Moscow. Russia will not be stopped at borders for sure. Time to disintegrate the evil regime and empire!,y076bf
Do they not have guidance systems on their missiles? That intersection doesn’t seem to be a particularly important target.,y076bf
"These cruise missiles are like $1M each, more or less, depending on who the info source is.  And the Russians are hitting civilian cars with them?  The Russians have lost their cool and are now making a strategic mistake.

It's sad that people are dying, but I am glad that the Russians are throwing a temper tantrum and wasting their limited missiles on non-strategic targets.

Be Brave, Ukraine.  Russia won't be able to do this much longer.",y076bf

"No guys, they are just delivering military equipment under the claim of an attack... they are wearing white flags for underwear... no other way for Belarus to donate unfortunately.",xzojch
Great news that Belarus will be donating armor to Ukraine,xzojch
The Belarusian government isn't paying attention to current events.  They will be humiliated on the battlefield at the cost of many young lives.,xzojch
"As Perun Lukashenko has nothing to gain and everything to lose if they   
would invade. I honestly doubt this is more than Belarus balancing A:   
keeping Putin happy and B: not committing political suicide.",xzojch
Operator starsky is one of my favorite personalities in Ukraine. Bros got humor and keeps us updated on every single bit. Godspeed brother.,xzojch
I'd like to think the Ukrainians have been mining the crap out of the borders. I hope ukraine has enough numbers to keep two fronts going.,xzojch
so if another country can join the fight on russias side its only fair others can join on ukraine side.,xzojch
Belarusians are not as brainwashed as Russians. This country will unravel in no time. Bye-Bye Lukashenko,xzojch
"Artificial Intelligence gave us the most likely result of a Belarusian attack on Ukraine

Have they seen what Ukrainians are doing to the Russian invaders?,xzojch
"+/- 6,000 troop invasion?   Makes little sense.",xzojch
Get ready for a full scale regional war if this happens.,xzojch
"Russia would be much better off not having Belarus in the war. 

If Belarus stays on their side, but occasionally credibly threatens invasion, Ukraine will have to keep forces tied up on the border. 

If Belarus invades and gets their army wiped out, Ukraine can then keep a smaller force there for border protection.",xzojch
"Stack em up high, Slava Ukraini!",xzojch
Russia is desperate and anything that can help take some pressure off of them from Ukraine's aggressive offensive in Kharkiv and Kherson has to be on their minds. By sending in Belarus you will tie up Ukrainian manpower/assests/supplies/equipment that weren't needed in the north and afford Russia a bit of respite and chance to dig in and consolidate and reorganize prior to winter to defend the land they do control and try to make it to spring with as much manpower and equipment that they can manage to muster. I don't believe Belarus will be successful beyond being a distraction that sucks up manpower and time. Russia is gonna use them like sacrificial lambs in an attempt to better their own current situation.,xzojch
"Poland, Baltics. Get ready to do your thing.",xzojch
"I hope not. But I can't help but wonder how many will switch sides once they enter Ukraine. If they have to fight, why not fight with Ukraine so that, combined, they can help free Belarus from Lukashenko and Putin.",xzojch
"Supposedly the reason Belarus didn't join in the attack in the first place was that their army was so against the idea, bordering on mutiny.

Remember that Lukashenka held onto power during the protests in recent years by his fingernails, and with Russian support. If Belarus went in these are sure to erupt again - who will put the protests down this time? Russian conscripts?",xzojch
Let them send it. They will all die on the spears of the impenetrable phalanx that is the people of Ukraine. What better way to bring down Lukashenko than to inflict a humiliating defeat on him. HIMARS time!!!,xzojch
Send some machinery to the border and start digging some mass graves for their soldiers to give them a warning of what to expect if they invade,xzojch
Oh they fucked up,xzojch
Kill all invaders.  No mercy for evil.  Slava Ukraine,xzojch
"I'd be surprised if they do attack, but I won't be surprised by what happens next. 

Ignoring the fact that the Belorussian military is obviously outclassed, Ukrainians have been very polite towards them considering Luka aided in Russian troops to literally try to stab Ukraine in the back (at Kyiv). I don't think they'd want to see Ukraine stop being polite.",xzojch
"Question if Belarus was to invade Ukraine does that let Ukraine turn loose the Himars and M240/Mars systems on thier territory.  I wonder how many of those are currently sitting near the border if they have credible information on an up coming attack. Between the mine fields prepared fire zones and fortified defenses, and air defenses plus being the wet season and Himars type systems how far do you think they could make it past the border. 

If I was a betting Man I would say 5 KM or less.  The first Km to confirm it is a real attack the next Km to confirm locations and calculate target positions.  The Next 3 Km is the death ground.",xzojch
"If they do, they’re soooooo dead. If the Russians got their asses kicked (with greater numbers of troops and equipment), there’s no way these bitches will last long against battle hardened Ukrainian troops.",xzojch
Weird time of year to invade.,xzojch
I think the belarussian military would pull a coup in old Luka is he gave the order,xzojch
"I'll be waiting for the Braveheart style Irish charge where they meet in the middle, shake hands, hug, then turn around and join the Ukrainian ranks, while taking their Russian ""commanders"" prisoner.",xzojch
"Lukashenko decided to retire, I guess... Liberate Belarus.",xzojch
"Highly doubt. Lukashenko barely has a hold on power, losing in Ukraine would seal his fate. Even he can see the tides have turned, why the fuck would he join the losing side this late",xzojch
"Belarus ain't doing shit. Lukashenko serves his own interests before anything else, this is little more than a threat to keep some Ukrainian troops tied up in the north just in case. Luka is essentially saying ""look Putin! I'm helping"" so it doesn't look like he ditched him, while also not getting his country annihilated. 

He's playing a balancing game.",xzojch
"I'll eat my hat if I'm wrong, but I highly highly highly doubt Belarus will attack the Ukraine.

Politically it's incredibly stupid. Ukraine is in such a strong position, and now very well connected to the EU and the West. Belarus would be best placed to switch sides now, though this is totally unrealistic without a power change.
Next best would be to declare a neutral status and demand Russian forces leave their land. Then help with the rebuilding of Ukraine/asking for forgiveness (not that its people do, the ones in power I mean)",xzojch
"Why are there no consequences for Belarus aiding Russia's invasion? Launching drones, staging forces.. this shit ain't right

Edit: Abrams export armor when?",xzojch
I hope they’re prepared for the cold winter is coming,xzojch
This is so sad and disappointing,xzojch
Yea like Ukraine and NATO are not watch enemy movements by satellite Smfh these morons are living in the 1980’s. Like give it up already!,xzojch
"6 battalions makes his whole story a bit weird, if they start something then they will have to at least muster 50k which is the max Belarus can do",xzojch
Isn’t like half of Belarus also not supportive of what their government is doing right now? This would indeed spark another civil war. Shit is legit like dominos right now,xzojch
May INLAW'S and Javelin's be by their side,xzojch
So the Ukrainian Border Guards will destroy the Belarus invaders?,xzojch
Fuck around and find out Belarus,xzojch
"They'll have 2 objectives: draining Ukrainian resources from the front lines and taking Kyiv.
But Belarus is not Russia, and NATO can blast those fuckers to oblivion.",xzojch
"NATO won’t attack but Poland sure might. Assuming Belarus can form 8 BTG’s worth of men willing to die for Putin & his minion Lukashenko. 
If it wasnt from Operator Starsky I’d think this was a nonsense rumor.",xzojch
"Belaruskies are idiots or suicidal.  There is no victory for foreign invaders of Ukraine, only death.",xzojch
If you know where they will enter ....one word: HIMARS,xzojch
Belarus has been doing a lot of unnecessary saber rattling lately. Maybe just trying to show support for Russia instead of actually commuting troops and equipment but sounds like they’re waiting for the right time to lend their support so they can claim a reward in the end if Russia wins (which they won’t). They threatened Poland the other day too and I just really hope Belarus stays inside their own borders.,xzojch
Godspeed operator Starsky,xzojch
"I thought Belarusian army told Lukashenko to fuck off the previous time, why would they help this muppet now?",xzojch
"I imagine , the Ukrainians know exactly what’s going on in Belarus .

Find it hilarious that Belarus and the Russians feel they can launch surprise attacks, when I’d imagine just about every satellite in western control is monitoring every inch of there territory 😂",xzojch
The Belorussian army may well change sides if forced to fight in Ukraine,xzojch
"Luckashenko will struggle to find enough guys that are willing to fight Ukraine he is mad, some of them are likely to surrender the minute they are over the border, nothing to stop them going back home with new friends and throw fat boy Luckashenko out",xzojch
"A lot of good responses on the negative aspects of Belarus attacking Ukraine, especially the political backlash from the citizens.  

My perspective is that Putin’s current benefit is to lock-in Ukrainians troops in Northern Ukraine snd keep them out of the war effort against Russia.",xzojch
"Plot twist: imagine if Belarus was the army that was actually competent, despite usually being the bottom in its relationship with Russia.",xzojch
"Still i think it's an effort to draw some Ukrainian troops from the east/south.
And yes, they will definitely die in Ukraine.",xzojch
"We can also expect, with certainty, complete destruction of all invaders",xzojch
Belarus: Well do a surprise attack it'll only take 3 days.,xzojch
I double dare you to attack,xzojch
"I suppose Ukraine is already keeping a ton of troops around Keiv incase Russia tries to attack there again, might aswell invade and secure that region so that Russia can't just drive right up to the border unopposed like the first time. 

And considering the state that Belarus is in, it would probably be easy. The ""Army"" is just glorified internal security to attack protesters at this point.",xzojch
Not so sure lakashenko's Generals and officers will agree to be a part of this mess.,xzojch
Maybe they want to boost their economy with sanctions.,xzojch
President Potato head is looking to become a mártir like Benito....lol,xzojch
Looks like Belarus is asking for a spanking. I'm sure the brave Ukrainian heroes will be happy to oblige,xzojch
"Russia (and, indeed, Belarus) would be *far* better served by not actually attacking, but instead holding these forces in a threatening posture near the border

An ""army in being"", if you'll excuse me butchering the Tirpitz's raison d'etre, will tie up far more Ukrainian forces than an actual attack.

An attack of 6 full strength BTGs would need to be met by about a brigade's worth of troops, who can pretty much face it head on and defend against it... and we've certainly learned Ukraine knows how to defend Kyiv

Whereas if those 6 BTGs are held near the border, they would need at least 2 brigades facing them to cover the places they *may* attack",xzojch
"How do they plan to supply these forces? Russia already struggles to maintain two fronts, they wanna open third?",xzojch
"Russia and Belarus probably have some sort of agreement that says something along the lines of:

*If Belarus does not help with the Ukraine Special Operation, then the leader of Belarus must stand near a 5th story window for an agreed upon length of time and location.*",xzojch
"It saddens me, that now the good people of Belarus also have to die in this senseless war ridden by madness.",xzojch
"we (Lithuania) should invade belarus, they don’t have nukes",xzojch
I think that this will provoke neighbouring countries to get involved directly. Plenty of Baltic states already smell blood and are probably aching to have a good reason to put them in their place.,xzojch
Where's Warstache? I'm sure he's got something brewing if this happens 😉,xzojch
What’s stopping nato from engaging Belarus if they do this? Mmmm mmm you got any more of dem regime changes?!,xzojch
If Belarus gets involved then NATO should destroy Belarus immediately. They should specifically Target Lukashenko. Wherever he is a guided missile should follow his fat ass,xzojch
I can also see Poland skull fucking Belarus if this happens,xzojch
If Belarus moves Poland will finally get its pound of flesh.,xzojch
"It’s going to see Ukraine not only to put Belarus out rather quickly, but to see them advance on the newly opened Belarusian front rather quickly all the way to Minsk to return Belarus back to its people. I mean I’m all for Belarus joining in. It likely means a Belarus free from Russian control in a rather short amount of time. It could take Belarus away from Russian use just like it just took Crimea. Those are both important staging grounds for Russia. It will be sweet to see them taken away from Russia not only in the war but after as well.",xzojch
Beware the fog of war. By the end of this coming week we could literally be involved in world war III.,xzojch
What will Poland do?,xzojch
Ucrainians are cyborg demons there s nothing to worry about,xzojch
Well can’t NATO fuck with Belarus since it’s not Russia to keep them in check?,xzojch
I hope Belarus is wiped off the face of the planet if they do. NATO should bomb Belarus if they do... it ain't Russia!,xzojch
Very bad news for Ukraine. Poland and Baltics will not join in.,xzojch
Get the Heemars ready boys!,xzojch

"They are going to send six BTGs... six.

That's like sending a kitten into a building infested with wolves.",xzojch
"Time for a guarantee by NATO, that anyone else who is attacking Ukraine will be annihilated.",xzojch
"Belarusian dictator is as unpopular with his people as Putler is with his currently. An invasion will not go well for him either. Having allies directly participate in the war, i think, increases the chances of a direct conflict with NATO.

RUSSIA …. THE PAPER TIGRE !!!!!!,xzojch
I do wonder with the amount of money and equipment invested in Ukraine whether the West can allow Ukraine to fall or if they noe have to step in,xzojch
Don’t write Belarus off too quickly. They’ve had months to watch the Russians get their asses kicked. There’s a chance they’ve changed tactics and will at least attempt a combined arms approach.,xzojch
a missile somewhere has lukashenko's name on it,xzojch
The West needs to step up weapons support and spank Lukashenko the Pencil dick,xzojch
"Yep, come get your ass whoopin.",xzojch
"You wanna know what kind of army Belarus has?

Around 50-60k active soldiers. Most of them being conscripts! 

Tanks? Around 900 T72B from 1985.

IFV? 1000 BMP 2. Yup, that's a crapton of armor.

A few hundred self propelled artillery and towed howitzers.

200-300 self propelled rocket launchers that date back from the old soviet days and would not hit a barn.

As with the Russians, they are too reliant on armored vehicles; they do not have enough manpower. Outdated and imprecise artillery systems.

They would get destroyed by the Ukrainians in a few weeks.

Their morale would be so low the entire army might defect to the Ukrainian side.",xzojch
I think NATO should take care of the Belarussians. Hit them on the head so hard that they cannot get up.,xzojch
six BTGs would be a few thousand men. That makes no sense. Belarus didn’t join the initial invasion and now they’re going to send a token force while Russia is loosing? Nope.,xzojch
Belarus quite literally cannot enter the conflict because Lukashenko has such a tenuous hold on his power. 0% chance he’d risk sending his security forces outside the country because he would face a legitimate chance of popular revolution.,xzojch
killed everyone that motherfuckers,xzojch
If Belarus invades I give it 30 days before Lukashenko is ousted.,xzojch
Doubt it. They’re only trying to split Ukrainian forces.,xzojch

Yes. Because last time there was a attack from Belarus it went well...or wait a minute...it didnt.,xzojch

I seriously doubt that this will happen. I hope I’m right as there will be a lot of dead Belarusians if I’m not.,xzojch
"Ah shit, here we go again.",xzojch
"Serious question, I know there were exercises a few days ago, but are there enough BCTs or equivalents to hold both? As inept as I think the ruski high command is, I wouldn't count on them passing up a Belarusia intervention as an opportunity for an offensive.",xzojch

"Belarus joining NATO in sending weapons to ukraine, thank you Belarus",xzojch
Well Belarus if they’ve been mostly sitting this out for a couple months might have been able to drill some things that they’ve learned from the eastern front it might mean Belarus partisans might pop up so I wonder if they try to hold small pockets or go farther,xzojch
Winter War 2: Electric Bogaloo,xzojch
Wel if this happened I will be very astonished.,xzojch
"People❗️❗️❗️ Rumors are being circulated around that, Belarus in case of a serious threat will release their strongest weapon on the battlefield - and will begin throwing potatoes at Ukrainian forces 🤣🥔",xzojch
"On August 26th, Lukashenko claimed that his su-24 warplanes were fitted to arm with nuclear warheads. 6 weeks later, they are about to potentially invade Ukraine? I see the dots connecting here I think?

&#x200B;

[https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2022/10/5/infographic-does-europe-have-enough-gas-for-winter](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2022/10/5/infographic-does-europe-have-enough-gas-for-winter)

&#x200B;

**""President Alexander Lukashenko says the Belarusian military’s SU-24 warplanes have been modified to carry nuclear weapons, and that Minsk would react immediately if the West caused it any problems.""**  
  
**""Lukashenko – the authoritarian leader of ex-Soviet Belarus – said he had agreed on the move to modernise Belarusian warplanes with Russian President Vladimir Putin""**

&#x200B;

JUNE 26TH ARTICLE: [https://www.cnn.com/2022/06/25/europe/russia-belarus-nuclear-capable-missiles-intl-hnk/index.html](https://www.cnn.com/2022/06/25/europe/russia-belarus-nuclear-capable-missiles-intl-hnk/index.html)

&#x200B;

   
**""Russia will transfer nuclear-capable Iskander-M missile systems to its ally Belarus over the coming months, Russian President Vladimir Putin said on Saturday.""**  
  
**""Putin told Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko at a meeting in St. Petersburg the missile systems “can use both ballistic and cruise missiles, both in conventional and nuclear versions,” according to the Kremlin.""**

&#x200B;

So they invade Ukraine from the north AGAIN, get their asses kicked and then claim ""Ukraine is invading belarus!11!!"" Then they send the SU24's airborne and launch the nukes?

&#x200B;

This is literally suicide for Lukashenko, who is deeply unpopular with his country's populace from what I read. He must be under pressure to do something.",xzojch
Feels like a 4 stage level in a videogame. Where each level increases difficulty. Kamikaze drone? What's next? ISIS?,xzojch
"About 4.8K soldiers (on the high end)  and 300 armored vehicles if wikis assessment of what’s in 1 BTG is correct (just multiplied it all by 6). Sounds like a “push through the Ardennes” kinda moment for Russia.

Edit: fixed some grammar lol",xzojch

American and NATO satellite systems would see them coming days before and put on notice Ukraine to prepare for this invasion.,xzojch
"What would Europes reaction be to this, now that Putins forces have been blunted?",xzojch
Can't Ukraine do a presumptive strike while they are building up?  A first strike presumptive hit will take 30-40% of Belarus force would go a long way,xzojch
“zero doubts that they will all die” is exactly the overconfident attitude that ensures they will in fact not all die,xzojch
may the invaders be slaughtered to the last,xzojch
"Lukashenko already has blood on his hands.  He allowed the RA to launch an invasion of Ukraine, fire tube artillery and missiles, and launch bombers from within his borders.  He is complicit.  I hope Ukraine and the West remember that.",xzojch
IMO! I hope either when the Belarusians invade Ukraine they will support the Ukrainian forces against the Russians or that the troops just turn around and go for Minsk and free that country! Because I know if lukashenco will send his loyal troops he has none to protect his internal security,xzojch
What a based comment. Fuck yeah! Slava Ukraini!,xzojch
Yeaahh baby,xzojch
Great news! Now Lukashenko will fall together with Putin. Cant wait to see those 2 countries be freed from dictatorship.,xzojch
Would be great to see the Belarusian terrorists turn into fertilizer like the Russian terrorists.,xzojch
"Yea the Belarusian army is a moneyless 50,000 person operation and when you figure two support people for every front line soldier the likely have 15k soldiers at best, and absolutely no intrinsic drive to invade a neighbor who will likely kill them all",xzojch
"Belarus attacks, Ukraine has been waiting for this and the Putin's lapdog Belarussians will die. This operation has been looked for and Ukraine is waiting, if Belarusian people do not want their sons to die for Putin, they will encourage them not to go.

&#x200B;

But if they go, well, they deserve to die.",xzojch
Why not hit them first. A good defence could be offence.,xzojch
"If that happens, Poland will enter the war. There's no way OTAN/EUA can hold them anymore!!!!!!!!!!",xzojch
I have no doubt that Putin is pushing for this. If another country attacks then surely Ukraine can get help from a Nato country. Its pretty outrageous that Russia can carry on with this.,xzojch
What a quote,xzojch
Can Poland has Brest?,xzojch
"But god for fucking bit Ukraine Ukraine actually strike into their land, can’t risk “escalating” the war now can’t we",xzojch
"I'm worried, Ukraine is pushing and gaining ground, if this is now a threat, they will need to move men to protect that flank, taking off some pressure off from russia.

Even if the troops from Belarus are on the same level as putins mongrels, its still men with guns and tanks that will need to be taken care of.

I can only imagine what putin promised to his buddy tyrant....putin will promise and give anything to give his troops some breathing space, ie, make him look better.",xzojch

This is clearly a stated sim from the leadership that enables and allows massive systemic and widespread crimes against humanity and war crimes to be committed that are collectively genocide.

"Wow! That instrument sounds really beautiful! He plays it very well, and his singing is great. Very touching and emotional. I must admit, prior to Russia invading Ukraine, I had like zero knowledge on their country and culture, but since then, I continue to be blown away by them. They are so incredibly talented in the field of the arts. So many gifted musicians! Just Ukrainians as a people, have such good hearts, and strong morals and values. They are incredibly brave people! Putin definitely picked the wrong country to fu€k with; that’s for sure. 
    But yeah, I’ve realized lately just how small my world truly is, with how little I know about other parts of the world, and different cultures. I definitely want to start expanding my knowledge on such things, and it’s a shame that it took such a tragic situation for me to get to know Ukraine a bit. They’ve quickly become my favorite people, and their unity and bravery inspires me so much! 
Slava Ukraini",y01h06
Beautiful,y01h06
That thing is cool! Like a guitar and a harp fused together!,y01h06
Beautiful music!,y01h06

"Holy shit. I know this grandpa. We used to live in the same district. He is completely blind and would ride on the bus each day to visit the park. Everyone knew him, so someone would always help him get on and get off the bus.",y01h06

"Father winter is almost here and things like this will be extremely important to the Ukrainian soldiers in the field.  Others have sent winter gear too.   Russia can't even get proper uniforms, shoes, on their troop, let alone winter gear.  Demoralized troops, that do not want to be there, freezing in trenches, suffering from supply starvation, could turn on their masters.",xzrciu
Russian soldiers go brrrrrr,xzrciu
The littel things make the difference.......it's not all and everything about Weapons and Ammo. That's a good one Germany!! Well done!,xzrciu
Let's go Germany!,xzrciu
Thank you Germany!,xzrciu
"Well done Germany, if every EU nation contributes a little Ukraine will have enough",xzrciu
I have a question..will Ukraine have to pay back after war or are they giving it for free as goodwill..pls tell,xzrciu
Upvote for Germany.,xzrciu
I guess this is why Russia is fucking around sabotaging infrastructure in Germany.  Russia knows it cannot match logistics from the west so they are trying to screw with it.,xzrciu
This is how you win winter warfare,xzrciu
"Fine, but be cautious with the heating.",xzrciu
Danke! Much appreciated.,xzrciu
And now tell me germany isnt doing anything....,xzrciu
"People bitching about „wHeRe TaNks?“ should think about sitting in a brand new tank after havin no sleep, frostbite, no energy and everything you touch is metal and will freeze your hands of.
These guys obviously have no fuckin combat experience nor have they slept, or used heavy weaponry in freezing conditions. So stfu ur opinion doesn’t matter.
I’ve been to Kosovo where it had -20 and I was damn happy to have warm clothes while sitting in a metal box! 

Sorry for the rant but this shit pisses me off",xzrciu
A massive step up from 5000 helmets.,xzrciu
"Thx for the clothes but they need LEOPARDS! The longer we wait, the more innocent people will die.",xzrciu
"Good stuff. 

And could you just slip in a few tanks as well from that wee redundant stockpile in the back there now....   would you. Thanks :-0",xzrciu
Damn Germany with a huge W they know their winter clothes,xzrciu
"This could very well be a huge factor in Ukraine's victory over the next few months!

If Russian troops are as unprepared for winter as the media is suggesting, this could be a matter of letting nature end the war.",xzrciu
"Guys, Germans, I am talking to you: are you really cool with it?
What type of government you got who cares about other countries more than it's own?",xzrciu
"That's cool and all but they still need main battle tanks, Germany. 😤",xzrciu
"All due to arrive in late spring, I'm sure.",xzrciu
The Germans really hesitate to offer a solid contribution. Clothes? How about some heavy weapons instead.,xzrciu
"Cool, Ukrainians will fire a tent to ruzzki tanks",xzrciu
But Will they get them before spring?,xzrciu
"That’s nothing compared to the billions of euros worth of gas they bought from Russia this year alone. 

The amount of money Germany spent on Russian gas would fund the entire Russian army for more than a year. Something to think about.",xzrciu
[removed],xzrciu
"Oh wooooow, uniforms!  How about tanks?  It’s hard being a Russia boot licker while trying to look pro Ukraine.  

How about those former German politicians sitting on the board of Gasprom?",xzrciu

How the skull can be so white?,xzw02p
Don't feed the wild animals,xzw02p

I dunno Scoob,xzw02p
I don’t know. Uniform looks a little too clean for a totally decomposed body.,xzw02p
"The skull is bone-white, but all the clothing and equipment looks almost new? Suspicious.",xzw02p
I’m all Ukraine and stuff but i haven’t seen a skull that white on a dead Russian yet are y’all positive this is a for real one?😭,xzw02p

#RUSSIA IS A TERRORIST COUNTRY",xzw02p
Be dead a long time,xzw02p
"That is quite epic, nice and clean",xzw02p
That cannibal really needs more at the front he picked that one clean.,xzw02p
ALERT: 100th dead russian I’ve seen on reddit since tuesday,xzw02p
Skull so white I thought it was one of those Halloween decorations.,xzw02p
"Free human skull.

Might need a lil bit more time for nature to clean it up more though, on second look.",xzw02p
Straight out of Fallout,xzw02p
"Take that watch! I saw you trying, go get it! That MF don’t need it anymore!",xzw02p
The skulle looks like fake beeing so white. But I have no doubt that it is genuine.,xzw02p
Idk if seeing Russian dead soldiers that were left behind  should get the NSFW tag anymore.  It seems so normal it’s not even gore anymore.,xzw02p
The gear is too clean. Looks like it was bought yesterday. 🤨,xzw02p
Not gory enough,xzw02p
It's a skeleton already? Ukranian nature works bloody quick.,xzw02p
"fake videos, again",xzw02p
"That’s the Russian world. Filth, hell, abject expendability. It’s why nobody wants anything to fucking do with it.",xzw02p
Why NSF?? I laughed 😅😅,xzw02p
Skullz,xzw02p
The Russians will be back to collect their fallen any minute now.,xzw02p
Fake,xzw02p
That boy has been there since late February.,xzw02p
"This has to be fake. There’s a store-bought clean looking skull, but also perfectly clean looking uniform and kit? If the body actually decayed that much, the clothes and bones would be discolored and deteriorated (for the clothes) to shit by the exposure. And the gloves look brand new, nor do they match. And the limbs, feet, and hands looked stuffed and puffy like a scarecrow. 

99.99% chance this is some fake shit.",xzw02p

"this is so cringe, especially after they tell Ukrainians in Crimea to “prepare bomb shelters for reoccupation measures..”

Ukraine did nothing to defend Crimea back in 2014 when Russia first came into the territory. All they did was turn the water supply off to the people in the region. Now, 9 years later, why are we pretending that their reoccupation of that region will be “liberation”? Those 2 million people in Crimea are not chess pieces. They just want to be left alone.

I completely understand Ukraine wanting to retake land that has been overrun since this February. But with Crimea, this strikes me as too little too late. In 2014, a majority of the Crimean peninsula was at the very least sympathetic to the Russian government. Post occupation, most of the most ardent Ukrainian nationalists have left. The remainder of the population there are either sympathetic to the Russian gov, or indifferent and just want to be left alone. It certainly doesn’t help that many Ukrainian nationalists have resentment for Crimeans for “letting” the occupation take place.

In my honest opinion this territory is being used as a chess piece, and the interests of the 2 million people who live here are being disregarded. It doesn’t make me happy to see things like this.",xzldcg

Money put to good use for once! Arm them some more as for **these extremely brave people are literally giving their lives to defend 400 million people west of their own country from Russian imperalism.** Though Im sure NATO can handle Russia with ease, it's the Ukrainians that are suffering in this war that never should of happened, as we know. Putine started this! Providing them every single need is the least the west can do.

&#x200B;

 The money is there, any talks of ""We don't have the money for ukraine, blah blah"" is just Russian disinformation and propaganda.

"He didn’t make this video necessarily for a show of strength for the war, he made this to start his bid for presidency. He knows there is an upcoming vacancy in the position. He has to show that he was the most competent and organized leader and that he contributed the absolute most to the war so it wasn’t his fault it was lost.

 “He gave everything he could for the cause while everyone else cowered and ran away or sent recruits who were not properly eligible or trained and that the train wreck that lost them the war is everyone but his own fault” so he should become the new leader(in his mind) so that he can run it the same way it has already been ran as well as how he has actually ran the areas of his own control. Great on paper, good on tv, and terrible and ineffective in real life. 

But apparently in Russia, great on paper and good on tv is all you need to be perceived as the best candidate to run the country. However, I hope that people of Russia learn their lesson this time around and don’t fall for it again, especially immediately, without digging for the truth.

I think the biggest logistical hurdle Kadyrov faces in his bid for European domination is getting his MMA Brigade to stop posting videos to Tik Tok so they don't get triangulated. That and allocating enough ammunition to neutralize any suspicious street signs along the way.

"A few words from Russian:
First of all - looks like muscle-play. A lot of soldiers. A lot of weapons and technique. 
BUT… In February Putin said this is “Special Military Operation for denazification and protection Russians in UA”. And now Kadyrov said nothing about protection of people. A lot of water about culture, traditions, religion. Hashtag «#НаКиев» looks like “Okay, our first plan fcked up… Lets just kick these Ukrainian and NATO asses for our President” No matter it takes for civilian lives, infrastructure and other… A lot of loud words… A lot of potential deaths on the both sides…",xzsybv

"I was going to say I can see 3 separate beads that form swastikas .
But when did we all accept the “thought” that the swastika has had only one meaning in history.

"The truth is Zaluzhny is a far better military leader than anyone in Russia and the bots are steaming. He’s clearly doing a fine job.

So now they try to find away to discredit him with this nonsense.",xzupv1
"I mean I can seen one in your first picture (second from the right) although it is not like the depicted one shown in the other pictures.

The problem with the swastika is, that it is older than the Nazis.
Different cultures have different meanings for it. In Buddhism it is still used and a swastika in the other direction signals/shows a Buddhist temple.

Russia can suck on Pzf3s… if they want swastikas, they should look under the shirts of leading personalities in their country…",xzupv1
Those are all Celtic and Viking symbols,xzupv1
"I want to take this opportunity to add that the Kievan Rus culture has origins in Swedish Vikings. 

The Kievan Rus are essentially what the Normans were to Western Europe. 

This culture was based heavily around Kyiv until the Mongol invasion. Several centuries later the Muscovites brokered a deal with the Golden Horde to collect taxes and pay tribute in exchange for control of several neighboring regions. Thus began the dominance of the Muscovian Rus.",xzupv1
"I see they failed their course on Norse mythology, expect nothing less of the typical Ruzzki",xzupv1
"You know the swastika was a religious symbol before hitler bastardized it? It’s still common to find it on charms etc in Asia. I have several buddhist items I got in Japan in 2017 that have them. Not old items, new items. It depends on it’s orientation. so even if that bracelet had one on it, going by the others shown it would be a sign of good luck. Nothing more.",xzupv1
"What the Ukrainians are beautifying themselves with are norse mythology symbolism, historically a counter part to russia, particularly after WW2, it's a big fuck finger to russia and what they stand for.

Ukrainians are now the European wolf, no longer under the power of the Russian bear.",xzupv1
"That bracelet is badass. I don't know about you guys but I feel like this war is kind of cleansing some of these ancient symbols. When the antifascists are wearing ancient Indo-European religious symbols too, it's hard to continue justifying that these are ""nazi symbols""",xzupv1

But also not surprised, some humans are like this when they hear another person in danger they don’t want to help most cases.

Canada declared them a terrorist state a while ago. We usually move in pretty close lock-step with the US on such things.,xzpc3p
Anyone know what actually happens if the US were to declare Russia a terrorist state?,xzpc3p
"The answer is very simple.  Russia is a terrorist state.  All good and descent nations need to declare this loudly.  Over a million Ukrainians kidnapped, thousands raped, murdered, tortured in places like Маріуполь, Буча, Лиман ......   What more does it take.  Does Putin’s dirty money run that deep everywhere?  Rationalization of evil begets more and larger evils.  

So simple.  Russia is absolutely clearly a terrorist nation.  Have the courage to proclaim this obvious fact clearly and loudly for the good of humanity!!!

Say that to the underpants of that driver. Massive damage.,xzpauy
"Of course it's not much, they are dropping what essentially is a frag grenade on a Tank.

Most likely the UAF drone dropped the munition on the tank as a way of saying to the tank: ""we know where you are and we're already targeting you"". The tank crew probably had a better placement than the UAF troops and once they realized the enemy knew where they were and they were being targeted, they properly chose to disengage/fall back/relocate. Right now, it might be a small bang but soon enough it might be an NLAW or artillery. They had to GTFO of the area and the UAF was probably able to advance to a more advantageous position.",xzpauy

"Looks like the wagons have dropped.  Either there bogies collapsed or the track spread.  The first would point to a phenomenal amount of heat, the second less so.  But the second will mean track relaying which will take time.  I think this bridge is mild steel in a box section?  The rails are quite a bit thicker than the bridge steel, so if the rails have moved, there's a good chance the bridge has.",xzrdnx

Drones can provide GPS.  Dude looks on Google maps and figures out where it is.  Program the artillery projectile with precise GPS.  Fire from upwards 40-60km away depending on artillery piece.  Glides in an detonates within 2-5 m 50 seconds later.  This looks to be an excalibur.  It has a distinctive downward explosive pattern.,xzrxcz

"Well if Russia hasn’t put together that Ukraine already has long range precision capabilities in hand such as ATACMS, they won’t be able to deny it for very much longer. And it’s obviously very effective at thwarting Russian AA systems. I think Ukraine could likely severely degrade the entire Russian army with about 250 of them alone. 

But if I was Ukraine, I’d be waiting to see how many reinforcements come in first and let the troops amass as much as possible before using them except of course in areas of importance that are currently planned for doing an offensive move. Go ahead and wipe out the rear logistics and AA in those areas with regular GMLRS and use a couple ATACMS on their bases and barracks and just walk on through popping the squirters that are too proud to surrender. 

When the average Russian finally gets to witness the truth about the destruction of their entire military forces and capabilities, they are not going to be happy. But by that time the will be seeing the truth about a lot of other things, and the military power *(lack thereof)* will likely be the least of their worries at that point.",xzp7ro

Ultimate Giga-Chad response.,xyv3z1

I see a new meme template incoming soon!,xyv3z1
The look on his face really said it! 🥰,xyv3z1

The only way for Putin to live is for Ukraine (and as many people as it takes) to die.
Both can't survive in the same world.

Putin knows this.
Zelensky knows this.

Putin WILL die.
The only question is how many people have to die before him.",xyv3z1
"It’s impossible for me to love him more.

All he wants is for his country to be left alone. And he has behaved like a true leader and protector.

Even now, as his resilience (and even dominance ?) has become more globally evident, he has not allowed that to fester into a personal vendetta against Putin.

“Leave us alone. Go away. I don’t care where you go but you gotta get the fuck outta here.” That’s all.

100% correct answer,xyv3z1
"And a stupid question from BBC. Do they see it only as a fight between two men or is it so disturbing for them to think that there would be no Putin, who is the new self-proclaimed Peter the Great and ruled so long? Britons seem to have fixation with Putin even though they have hugely supported Ukraine.",xyv3z1

"The “What do you think about—“

Why would he care lmao,xyv3z1
"I truly hope Putin lives.

Long enough for Saddam Hussein to go “whoa, you too buddy?”",xyv3z1
I feel the same but I also don't care if this guy dies. Both of them have caused the deaths of thousands of people.,xyv3z1
Interesting. It looks like he hadn't even thought of that. Almost like he has no intension of going any further than his own borders.,xyv3z1
Great “journalism”!,xyv3z1
"He should care. A cornered dog will bite back hard as it has nothing more to lose. As frustrated as it is, it is best to give Putin a way to end the war without too much of embarrassments. He is losing the war and might lose power in Russia due to that. That’s nothing to stop him from bringing down Ukraine and Russia together with him by deploying nukes when cornered and embarrassed too much. Putin is not a logical man at this point. Best case scenario, Ukraine gets back all the lands lost to Russia including Crimea, but make certain political concessions/treaties that can save this disgraceful man’s face a bit while still achieving peace for the country.",xyv3z1
This looks like response from NATO chief when asked about Ukrainian people.,xyv3z1

The guy looks mentally distressed something not all there.,xz4qgm
"The 1420 channel is a good channel to get an idea of the kind of thoughts Russians have about certain events. It takes the interviewer  quite a while to find enough Russians to talk on camera.

"I would like to see the documents at the end in this video. Its interesting to me. My mother just gave me a gift of many old documents about how much money my family and community gave to rebuild a village in Russia many years ago. Two of which spent many years helping rebuild.  Its odd how Russians claim Americans hate them and we are their enemies. Yet, I have an entire box of personal proof that suggests otherwise. I have letters, pictures, newspapers, and all kinds of suprises in here. I wonder what Russians say when they think of these selfless acts. You know the families my family rebuilt their houses and helped them out of poverty. I think I shall write to them a letter and express my deepest regret what my family did for them. Where are they now I wonder as their fellow man insults me.

It was a gift to me upon my return from Ukraine.

What a horrible gift to be handed to me. I wanted to light it on fire. Instead I look at it in horror. 

I would like to annex the village and houses my family built there and give it to someone worthy. Where are you? Did you march to Ukraine and spit on my flag after your house was built? You make me sick.

Glory to Ukraine. Ukraine might forgive you. I will not.",xz4qgm

   Unlike the Younger Generation most have little to no exposure to Outside News. They really Believe the Eastern Provinces of Ukraine are filled with Pro Russians who are ethnically Russian and are persecuted by an illegal elected pro-western Nazi government in Kyiv.
   They think the Russian Army is actually SAVING innocent people from genocide and that the Ukrainians need to be punished and weakened, if not destroyed.

"Good photo (from satellite, i believe) of the blast damage. Dark blast mark on the top surface of the roadway indicates blast occurred on top of it, not from beneath. Also interesting to see how the blast collapsed part of the roadway quite a ways to the east (left side of pic).",xz8t0d

"I really believe that the majority of Russian citizens have no clue about what is really happening. I think that they think that their boys are out slugging it out in some pig farm somewhere in Ukraine. This is the witching hour. How are the leaders going to explain this to their population? Geeze man ..I don't like war. I've been there. It's not right.

I hope God strikes down, just this once so that everyone can get back to being human beings. How does anyone explain the value of life to their children when every day presents us slaughter, rape, theft, murder and loss of dignity? Help us. Please",xz8t0d
The fact that such a long part of the bridge collapsed just goes to show what a shitty and rushed job the russkies did at building it.,xz8t0d
"Wow, that was an amazing amount of force.",xz8t0d

One down. 2 to go.  Then it's duck hunting the ferries if the Russians will just keep the civilians away.,xz8t0d
"I’m not even close to being an engineer, but looking at that image the blast appears to have came from underneath and literally lifted and shifted the roadway deck off the pier cap. This lift is what caused the gap and secondary collapse of the roadway seen on the far left of the image as when the main explosion happened the lift caused the disconnection. When the roadway at the point of explosion lifted it also was shifted outwards away from the pier cap. This gives some indication of the direction of the explosive charge as a downward force explosion would not either cause shift or collapse of the pier. Even if a truck bomb was able to cause such a pier collapse the damage to the roadway would be extreme, but looking at the decking in the image you can see it has no significant damage or melting and looks to just have suffered scorching, likely from just the burning off of the explosive element. I could be wrong but this seems almost all too obvious.

Ps…the saboteurs of the bridge likely knew the train would be there and knew what it was carrying and timed when the attack should happen quite perfectly.",xz8t0d
another lane = more HIMARS tonight!,xz8t0d
Next one should be a remotely piloted submarine packed with TNT to take out those pillings.,xz8t0d
Is the rail bridge still usable?,xz8t0d
Has there been any **solid** intel as to what actually caused the explosion?,xz8t0d
"This was obviously an air burst a few feet *over* the roadway, that's why the road is not pockmarked or torn to pieces; instead, the spans are fractured from being pushed down by the air burst and you see the blackened surface from the burst. There are also no pockmarks on any other structures, or debris from an exploded truck.",xz8t0d

"Ruzzians seem to emulating a formation supposed used by Imperial Japanese Naval Academy cadets before the end of WWII.

Search 江田岛健儿之歌 for a video clip from a postwar Japanese movie about life in the Imperial Japanese Naval Academy during WWII.

Differences are:

1. Scions of the ruling elites and the best and brightest competed so heavily for admission to the IJN Academy that was not only more prestigious than Tokyo Imperial U before the end of the war, its admission rate is a bit more selective than even the most selective Ivy/peer elite universities(\~3%).  In contrast, the scions of Russian ruling elites and best and brightest tend to avoid having anything to do with the Russian military.  One exception is the FSB.
2. Imperial Japanese military officers were just as, if not more evil than Ruzzians, but at least they lead from the front and died with their men, not run away leaving their soldiers/sailors to fend for themselves.",xzb6tm

"Such a cheaply made bridge.

Russian engineering strikes again.",xz1pjf
This was all putins plan to create an off ramp so people can see the moskva.,xz1pjf
"Tough to tell, but the lack of scortch marks on the under side of the span, and no twisted support brackets undermines the theory of the blast coming from below.",xz1pjf
Its a new special operations water slide. The lazy river should be opening soon. Can't wait for the grand opening.,xz1pjf
"I felt confident bomb was placed under bridge on top of a pillar but now I'm not sure anymore. Hope we get more close up pictures of that pillar. Also interesting missing piece on the road that hangs down, I would have expected road to break off in a straight line. Perhaps explosion was between pillars?",xz1pjf
They made a slide weeee,xz1pjf
Such a beautiful view. Heroyam slava!,xz1pjf
Found Putler's offramp,xz1pjf
thx for all the 1440p photos. now our boys can analyze them and aim the next missiles even better,xz1pjf
"I love reading the comments, it’s like armchair CSI. 
We have lots of creative observations going on and theories.
💪",xz1pjf
I'm not a civil engineer but as mechanical engineer i think that this structure is laughable cheap and light.,xz1pjf
"It took a while, but Ukraine's road to the Moskva exhibit is finally complete!",xz1pjf
"IDK exactly how they did it, but I bet they can do it again when it suits them. Russia had already defended  it to the hilt, to little effect. Crimea’s fuel security is now seriously vulnerable, even if they do get the railway running again as they claim.",xz1pjf
Maybe they shouldn’t have used roofing sheets to hold the road bed up then! 😂😂😂,xz1pjf
Looks like that bridge is rusting already to. Looks like on the left side where the deck metal connects to the crossbeam is rusted out. I was also wondering if it was not a truck but a boat that blew but after looking at this it probably was a truck as you the on the far right corner all the metal is bent downward hinting at an explosion from above.,xz1pjf
Is that span steel and not tensioned concrete?,xz1pjf
If the Russians don't know that the guy who blow up the bridge in crimea  was a Syrian guy that  trained by turkey so it means they don't know anything about politics,xz1pjf
"Im a builder not an engineer, I blew up that pic it would be great to see the other side and if there are any engineers on here, there opinion as well. I think if it was from below, boat or placed charge I would expect to see damage not just scorching on all of the concrete that sized blast would have destroyed the concrete bed for the bridge trusses and the movement rollers, there is some damage noted but it is superficial. There also appears to be very little damage to the steel work of the other span, I would have expected that from a blast of that size, I would have expected deformation and buckling in the smaller members. I have to say I do think it was a massive truck bomb.

I do note that when they constructed this the truss beams that take the beams the road deck plates are laid on are all jointed down the middle, I would prefer to see the joints staggered left to right ie 1/3 span 2/3 span, Im sure its engineered to take it, but this bridge has always been and will always be a military targett and likely to be attacked at some point, a more detailed examination with better pictures im sure other weaknesses could be found, Putin had this built at speed",xz1pjf
Героям слава!,xz1pjf
Nope. Not under here.,xz1pjf
[removed],xz1pjf
Us gov should of donated  some thermite or wat ever took down World trade center.  Would of been much better result hf they could pull it off,xz1pjf
"You can see the hole of the explosion. Metal is bent downward, no scorch marks at the bottom, but it's all scorched at the top. Explosion was at the top of the bridge (truck is very plausible).

That bridge is just metal beams and cheap road surface at the top, not made of concrete as I thought. Ukrainians take note.",xz1pjf

"Another lucky Russian SOB!   Like a reprieve from a death sentence on the front lines and he will get 3 hots and a cot away from it all.  I am not sure what the prisoner count is on both sides, but thinking Ukraine must have more than enough now to exchange for all of theirs being held by the Russians.",xzaxec

May the cat's stealthy ness be transferred to Soldier ! Slava Ukraini,xyu04s

pussy cats are amazing. giving love and warmth in a dark hour,xyu04s
Devouring copious amounts of orc corpses for days on end must make felines sleepy…Is this the case here possibly?,xyu04s

"Using up their ammo stockpiles before they have to run away due to no supplies.

They are learning from their past mistakes, bit by bit. Lol.",xywa78
Wasting their supplies for revenge and not strategy.  Smart,xywa78
Remember back in the good old days when the Russians were confident that they could take Kyiv in 3 days. Of course they are pissed.,xywa78
"Cigarettes, bad weather or some events that are going according to plan maybe...",xywa78
[deleted],xywa78
Emotional temper tantrum of leadership busier satisfying  their ego than developing an actual strategy,xywa78
"Yeah - whats the master plan here ? How do we even the score for farging up our bridge that was protected by dolphins with lazer guns. What skullduggary can we institute in order to make up for the fact that we are just a false nation - a horde. Now were a horde without a fuckin bridge !

We need to cover up for the fact that those dolphins protecting the bridge where actually big carp that cost 1 ruble each. Doesnt matter if we call one of them Flipper - they are still carp. On paper they are dolphins that cost 50 million USD each - on guard duty they are carp that cost 1 ruble.

They NEVER stay at their posts and really have trouble holding an AK for any length of time. They are also abject cowards in a firefight. Those feckin guard carp, we should have just taught the Chechens to swim ffs.",xywa78
"Emotional military responses make you more than predictable, it makes you playable.",xywa78

"Kremlin insider spoke truth to power, telling Putin this was screwed up from the start and he can’t salvage a victory.",xywa78
"Because it’s Putin’s birthday and they didn’t get him anything.

And then the Ukrainians show up with a big package and give him a blowout birthday party.

Sorta makes them look bad.",xywa78
Russia has decided to kill more civilians. We need war crimes trials when this is over.,xywa78
operation: rain fire has started,xywa78
Orcs maulding,xywa78
Context on this picture full of icons?,xywa78
"Ahhhh Russia being terrorists as usual.  They claim the bridge just like the mkscova was accidental or whatever and then the next day terrorise the country in  retaliation.  What a bunch of degenerates.  They are OK killing and raping and kidnapping and all else, but when Ukraine has a success, they can't stand it and think it's ok to target and kill people.  That country is way too far gone.",xywa78
Russians respond by predictably killing more civilians. These horrible fuckers really inspire hatred. I hope get smashed out of Ukraine and and there shite hole country collapses. They have only one tactic to respond to Ukrainian skill and bravery. Its this display of despicable cowardly warfare. Then they run away or surrender when face to face with soldiers.,xywa78
Yeah I wonder 🤣🤣,xywa78
Fuck um,xywa78
Little ironic to use more ammunition when your supply chain has had a major disruption.,xywa78
Is that a milk run to the far south lol,xywa78

What map is thi,xywa78
"their only connection to crima from mainland russia was destroyed intirely, on their leadwrs birthday, no wonder they are made.",xywa78
Fuck Russia killing more innocent civilians on purpose. They truly are a terrorist state. Fuck em.,xywa78
Is that nuke emblem actually a nuke? Or just a bigger bomb than the other missiles?,xywa78
"Thats also the reason why MORE weapons need to be delivered to UA when they are running through russian lines not less, and why its way more difficult to hold your gains than winning battles. Its because the russian frontlines are shrinking and the UA frontlines are expanding. Russia is able to pump the shit out of concentrated firepower, stuffing more and more reservists in. UA needs more supplies and a stabilized starlink to withstand the new chapter of this war.",xywa78
"What you sow you reap !!! 
I think Russia has made an enormous mistake Huge???",xywa78
Pootin ya fucken sook!,xywa78
 wasting they’re dwindling ammunition  to commit war crimes,xywa78
Terrorism.  Americans should understand.,xywa78
Damn orcs!,xywa78
"Nice, waste your now limited ammo on non-military targets and give away your artillery locations at the same time. Russia is smart.",xywa78
We will not give up before russia has list the war and russia has collapsed . Its not far away. If they use nukes they will loose even faster. Russia has no right to exist anymore they are worst then the Nazis in 1940.,xywa78

"Hit an oil train perfectly, so that will definitely damage the bridge. AND they got the road bridge! Damn! Hopefully they can’t fix it too quickly with that mess",xyjjv9
"It's interesting to wonder what exactly was used to do this. Of the various possibilities, I think a precision artillery strike seems least likely, because of both the range and precision required. Perhaps one of the fuel cars on the train was sabotage with a GPS-triggered explosive device, although it's hard to see how that would cause the road section to collapse first like that. Most likely IMO is a special forces sabotage operation. Which appears to have been very successful, but perhaps the only slight disappointment is that one side of the road bridge perhaps remains operational.",xyjjv9

Extreme heat will crack cement. Change metal temper in the rebar. Bends the rails.  Explosive shock waves can throw things out of true.  Fire is right over two cement piers holding everything up.,xyjjv9
What temperature do you slow cook a bridge at anyway,xyjjv9

Where is air defense? lol,xyjjv9
Looking at the chat this is clearly a good thing for the Ukrainian forces. But can someone explain why? I’m guessing it’s because Ukraine have now stopped ruzzian forced being resupplied by bases in crimea?,xyjjv9
Looks like a fire FIMARS 🔥,xyjjv9
Hey!  You can’t park there!,xyjjv9
Is the other side of the road still usable?,xyjjv9

 I dont expect them to attack as much in winter so the window for pushing is closing. But even if they manage to push south to put stress on russian supplies with winter setting in it'll be hard for Russia to maintain a steady supply in ukraine and especially crimea. Gonna be hard for citizens there. They are gonna be unhappy.",xyjjv9
"Bring out the ferries...
🤔",xyjjv9
Cry me a river!,xyjjv9
Fan Fucking Tastic!!!,xyjjv9
Think about the perspective of the Russian security personnel on this bridge. They’ve been told over and over again that the bridge is safe. They have nothing to worry about. They’re probably naturally lazy anyway and their job is miserable and boring. I bet it’s not impossible for a daring group to sneak a car bomb or rig an oil train and get it past them.,xyjjv9

Crazy shit. Hope no one was hurt.,xyjjv9
OMG this is huge news!,xyjjv9
Unfortunately what sucks now and why Ukraine purposely hadn't hit that bridge already is because they wanted russia to have a way to retreat. Now russia HAS to hold onto the land it took as its the only way to get to Crimea now. Regardless I'm still happy it's been done. That's a big kick in putins balls and now makes it nearly impossible to reinforce the south easily.,xyjjv9
LET’S FUCKING GO!!!,xyjjv9

How exactly does official Russian security video like this instantly get posted worldwide?,xz21t1
"Was it a truck though? The news in my country showed a video where you could see what appeared to be something floating in the water just before the explosion, and I gotta say that this theory seems a lot more plausible.",xz21t1
"""And what are all those large plastic barrels holding, Mr. Driver?""

""Goat yogurt, for the Chechen forces.""

""Right. Off with you, then.""",xz21t1
Video I saw looked like the explosion wasn’t centered around this truck rather ahead of it.  My evidence is poor though,xz21t1
This video is bollocks. Russian nonsense to deflect from the fact there air defense failed again,xz21t1
"""All good back here.  Just stolen washing machines.""",xz21t1
"~~And then we have the original security video that shows the truck intact for a couple of frames between the detonation and the moment flames filled the screen. I have a hunch the truck is just a scapegoat of sorts.~~

See my other comment",xz21t1
"I think we figured out a few hours ago that it was not this truck.

Edit: I now see that there is a great deal of contention still regarding the cause. Seems like most credible analysts are back to saying it was a truck bomb",xz21t1
Suicide truck bomber doesn’t make sense…it’s out of character of anything we’ve seen so far.,xz21t1
"I don't think the truck exploded first. In the security footage the explosion appears under the bridge, a blinding light and then you see a smaller white light where the ""truck bomb"" was. 

The damage to the bridge doesn't make sense with the explosion either. Bridges are made to handle downward force. This bridge had catastrophic damage to the support structure. A truck bomb would have just caused superficial damage to the surface with most of the energy going out and up. 

  
The supports on this bridge were collapsed and entire sections fell into the sea. That makes me think the target of the explosion was actually a support pillar. The blast would have hit the pillar from the side and the bridge underneath pushing up. Bridges aren't normally designed to handle forces from these directions. The blast would have caused the pillar to fail  and the bridge would have collapsed like we see in the aftermath. 

If you think about it Ukrainians shell the shit out of bridges and it just punches holes in them. If they were as easy to destroy as this makes them see, you could obliterate bridges with a few HE rounds.",xz21t1
FSB FALSE FLAG,xz21t1
The Kremlin dwarf is not to be trusted.,xz21t1
"""Yes comrades, these are just special cabbages destined for the motherland.""",xz21t1
I think you forgot to add a watermark. If is there it is barely visible,xz21t1
"Maybe they turned one of those seals that the Russian navy was training, they were on here a while back.",xz21t1
"The convenience of blaming a truck bomb is that people will readily believe that security idiots didn't do a good job, and can be replaced with new people, who will obviously not want to make the same mistake. So, no problem, right? And the Russian public are not critical thinkers who analyze the details of the stories they're told. They may not even notice that the truck came from Russia.

Whereas if they blame a boat bomb, then maybe security in the water is poorly designed, or just not possible? It isn't as easy to lock down the ""easy to fix"" story.",xz21t1
The explosion came from under.,xz21t1
"Except this same truck was on an incline during the explosion. And then the aftermath photos showed damage to a straight/flat section. Plus no debris ontop the road, and the fact a large wake in the water appears milliseconds before the explosion leads me to believe it was some other type of delivery. Not by truck-load.",xz21t1
"It wasn't the truck.

Not only would it need to be absolutely bursting with explosives to cause that big of an explosion (something that the security guard *would've* noticed) but you also can't take down a bridge like this without some serious effort.

The explosion was on a pillar and almost definitely came from below. Any explosion on the bridge would've expanded outwards and lost most of its energy whereas an explosion below would've expanded upwards, pushing the road sections and causing greater damage.

This was almost certainly Ukrainian saboteurs or special forces. I don't think a boat/barge packed with explosives could've sat in-wait under the bridge without being noticed. It would've likely been in dozens of the leaked security footage by now if it were. And it didn't sail into position exactly as the train passed; that was intentionally timed.",xz21t1
Someone going to be in big trouble over this fuck up,xz21t1
Somebody is losing their job,xz21t1
"""partial"" inspection",xz21t1
Was the truck coming from or heading to Russia?,xz21t1
"So this probably wasn’t a suicide mission, rather the truck got secretly loaded with explosives by somebody right?",xz21t1
So what it was a suicide bomb ..? Dude must of had a ride waiting for em or didn't know the bomb was there? Crazy,xz21t1
"Poor driver, I hope he knew what was going to happen and was able to prepare for it.",xz21t1
So Russia is saying it was a VBIED?,xz21t1
You really have to be a special Ed student to not have noticed that the explosion came from just off in the water maybe six to ten meters from the bridge and looked exactly like a cruise missile america loves to use when the president is unpopular.,xz21t1
It was missiles and this truck just got really unlucky,xz21t1

Your dictators are simply using your religion to manipulate you into fighting their senseless war for them, to expand their influence, power, and wealth… while you sleep in some freezing cold forest in Ukraine, with no food or the proper, necessary equipment to wage war. You are cannon fodder. How gullible do you have to be to be willing to put your life on the line for a dude like Putin or Kadyrov?! And you claim to be so religious and you act so self righteous, yet you willingly kill innocent Ukrainians without any hesitation. Isn’t it only a holy jihad when you are protecting your home land from invaders? You Chechens are HELPING the invaders, killing innocent people, and committing heinous atrocities and war crimes.. and for what? How can you justify your actions? I’m not religious.. in fact, I’m an atheist, but what do you suppose Allah thinks about your actions? Do you really think you’re going to ascend to paradise when you die, after all of this evil you have perpetrated? Yeah, no. Just go home to your goat. She needs you! Who else is going to provide for and raise your baby goats?! Priorities!!",xz6w05

Fiery hot shrapnel from a giant explosion will do the trick,xyy459
"The way the sparks fell, it looked as though there was thermite involved

It wouldn't take much of that to land in the tanker cars and cause a fire",xyy459
How does an explosion and giant fireball catch a freight train full of tanker cars full of flammable liquid on fire? Is this a serious question?,xyy459
"So.. Russia wants us to believe that someone snuck a truck full of explosives into russia controlled territory during a war, to their most vulnerable piece of infrastructure.. unchallenged.. just so an agent could commit suicide in the hopes of taking out the bridge? As opposed to just sneaking a much smaller, much easier to conceal bomb onto the train at any point during it's travels then remotely detonating it or hitting the train with a missile from a drone while it traveled?  


Russia is picking the answer that makes them look the most inept for some reason and I still don't believe them.",xyy459
Well let's see... Fragmentation of the explosion could pierce the trains and ignite it. The concussive blast could have broken weld spots where ignition could occur after the contents started to leak then the remaining fallout that's still on fire ignited it. It's simple physics.,xyy459
"Is there any evidence for ""truck bomb"" beyond that truck being in the wrong place at the wrong time? 

Don't get me wrong, that truck does seem awfully close to the blast to be discounted, but other than that, you can't rule out coincidence, the videos show it was a massive blast, and far from ruled out sappers/frogmen/whatever from having planted explosives underneath...

In any case, I would be... less than surprised... if another accident befalls the bridge in the immediate future...",xyy459
The sight of a russian helicopter trying to extinguish a fire oddly reminds me of Chernobyl.,xyy459
And what about the driver of the truck lol... it's a kamikaze mission?,xyy459
It's called a bomb.,xyy459
"There definitely was two, possibly three closely timed explosions when you watch the videos.  That may have been a truck bomb where not all of the explosives detonated at once?

Detonating a truck bomb with a train loaded with fuel passing would have required incredible luck or perfect timing.  Presumably loaded with stuff like mortar rounds that would be flung out, penetrate the train cars and start fires?

If it was a truck bomb and not a suicide mission, another vehicle would have been following  them, they would presumably stop on the bridge like they had suffered a breakdown, driver starts the delayed action fuse and jumps in the escape vehicle which then has to exit the bridge and make a clean getaway before the bomb goes off just as the train is passing.  And that's accounting for any delays getting the truck inspected before getting on the bridge.  Wow.",xyy459
"Thought this as soon as I saw the train fire.

Rule #1 Russia always lies.",xyy459
"Infernal satanic magics - from the very same labs that brought the disease bats,  Jewish space lasers, and Covid. Investing In that lab was the best idea the US has had in a long time. Its paying off in spades.",xyy459
Superior planning and execution.,xyy459
"X-ray machines aren’t that good at detecting explosives. Seems pretty simple to get a guy to take a delivery across the bridge. 

I highly doubt it was a suicide attack",xyy459
Bicycle trap bomb🤣,xyy459
"Well I was guessing they were going to say the train derailment caused the fire…

A little bit bubble gum and tracks will soon be ready for service.. LoL

All for Ukraine !!",xyy459
Look up the Oklahoma city bombing of the fbi building,xyy459
I think we won’t ever know the exact details until this war is over.. only thing we do know is that bridge got fucked !,xyy459
"It was a very big explosion with lots on burning debris (maybe incendiary) and a fierce wind, acting like a blow torch.",xyy459
"Bridges are designed to carry incomprehensibly huge loads and survive extreme weather conditions. The amount of energy required to break a span of bridge is insane, especially when you factor in how much of the explosive energy gets wasted in the atmosphere. In WW2 Britain designed the Grand Slam bomb (which is huge) which was meant to penetrate the earth near a bridge so explosive force wasn't wasted in the atmosphere. Now that waste energy in this case is sending a lot of hot debris flying extremely quickly, not helpful for destroying it's intended target but fortuitous in so far as it took a train.",xyy459
"Call it whatever, send more truck bombs then🤦‍♂️
Slava Ukraini 🫡🇺🇦",xyy459
"If the first lie doesn’t work, lie harder.",xyy459
They had a postage stamp set up and printed already! Come on! SLava Ukraine,xyy459
Umm... because explosion was fucking big....,xyy459
This was a complex operation it was a “special operation.” 🤣🤣🤣,xyy459
Big boom,xyy459
Thermite .,xyy459
My money is still on a cruise missile,xyy459
Wait are you suggesting the Russians are LYING!???,xyy459
I believe it was a bomb from a boat/barge. Probably 40 thousand pounds of ANFO. The displaced section of road has no damage to the guardrail or the road surface. The whole section was lifted off if it’s structure and dropped into the water. The damage to the adjacent rail bridge was done by shrapnel striking the soft tank cars which ignited. I don’t see Ukrainians doing the suicide truck bomber thing. Also the Russian side of the causeway has an X-ray device to scan trucks. I think this was a Ukrainian equivalent of A NAVY SEALS operation,xyy459
"truck bombs pack quite a punch, it's happened in london before",xyy459
"It was a big ass explosion. Imagine a grenade, but the size of a truck. Shrapnel will be everywhere, and that fireball was huge. Not saying it happened like that, though, but a truck exploding could blow up the train.",xyy459
"Putin’s new tractor for his 70th birthday backfired in the trailer….. no worries, all is good.",xyy459
"Oh boy, should have known the bridge attack would start an inevitable cascade of speculative theories (and conspiracy theories) all across the believability spectrum. I'm waiting to hear that it was actually a second sniper with a javelin missile, firing from the Grassy Knoll.",xyy459
"Y'know shrapnel is a thing, right...?",xyy459
"Whatever Pootin and Russian TV nazis say, it guarantees the opposite is true.",xyy459
"I've probably got it all wrong, but to me the video seems to show explosive matter coming  down on the road, from the rail bridge side, not up from the road. Am I confused?",xyy459
This is what is looks like in the video of the blast. Clearly they had insider help to pull this off.,xyy459
"If there are enough explosive traps, the shock wave and fire is enough to do the job.",xyy459
Also rapid compression causes ignition same principal a diesel engine works.,xyy459
It was a Big bada boom!,xyy459
"Easy.  Kitty, Kitty, Bang, Bang has been converted to truck.",xyy459
The answer is Cotton. Just Cotton.,xyy459
"I asked in another post about this if any explosives experts can tell us if the pressure wave would be powerful enough to overpressure the fuel containers and cause them to explode like this. I assume the fuel is diesel/naphtha/kerosene for turbines, diesel engines and aircraft, and diesel engines start using pressure and heat, not a spark or a flame.

I’m not saying the video is real, who knows what Russian propaganda gets up to, I’m just curious about the hypothetical.

I’d also love to see someone pull a r/theydidthemath explanation to prove or disprove the hypothetical.",xyy459
It was a big bomb I guess.,xyy459
Either a missile or the truck exploding would still need to make the train catch on fire. It's likely due to hot shrapnel.,xyy459
Shitty fuel ignites from heat.,xyy459
It was a special parking operation,xyy459
hello this is  loud  go factoring diplomacy.  ball,xyy459

That’s no Crimea! That’s my local Walmart 2 am and no cashiers !,xytn6s
0:18 is that a cart filled with 8+ bottles of vodka?,xytn6s
"With every cart full to the top, the store still looks extremely well stocked. Morso than my local markets lol. They must have some really great stocking employees.

Not to mention lots of toilet paper. Tbh, I would be on the tp, as that takes up more space to ship, and probably wouldnt be marked as a priority over food if things get strained.

I wouldnt call it panicked, but there are some people planning ahead.",xytn6s
Looks like a well stocked and modern hyper market. Why are Russians stealing washing machines and unable to poop in toilets? Are these Russians somehow better off? Also note the western brands like Nestle still selling their goods. Sanctions my ass.,xytn6s
Actually looks very civilised and ok. Could’ve been a Saturday evening in Germany.,xytn6s
"Ngl, this supermarket’s shelves still look fuller and better stocked than the average Aussie coles. We are not even locked down anymore lmao and it’s still hard to buy pasta some times haha.",xytn6s
"As they say in finance: don’t panic, but panic first",xytn6s
It’s because they probably don’t really know what’s happening.,xytn6s
A big difference with US hoarding.  Here every cart would be filled to the top with Toilet Paper.  I have no idea what this says about the American psyche but it is interesting fact.,xytn6s
"It’s so horrifying to see Russians casually invading a country for vacations, while their military is raping, killing, ,stealing, torturing, and destroying families. 
You have to be a certain kind of monster to still go spending time at a beach that your country.
I’m sure they’ll have the gall to cry about reconciliation, in a few years.",xytn6s
They'll need more toilet paper,xytn6s
If that was the UK there would be trollies full of toilet roll 😂.,xytn6s
Last chance to buy in a Russian supermarket,xytn6s
"Well, this is quite rational. Train bridge is damaged and 90% of good are transported using it, so prices will go up, some goods will not be available at all.",xytn6s
"Yes yes yes, but the true sign of an impending disaster is the lack of toilet paper oh dang there’s plenty ok thank you nevermind…",xytn6s
They are leaving a lot of toilet paper on those shelves,xytn6s
They know the hell that's about to rain on them!,xytn6s
"Sad, but this reminded me Feb 24. I was in a line just like that. We just wanted to make sure we have some food at home if the shops shut down. I remember a lady who asked me to watch her cart while she runs to pick up another item and I asked her to pick me a loaf of bread because I've forgotten it too, and it was a nice moment of human connection in the midst of chaos. I never had so much eye contact with strangers, everyone was looking for some comfort, for someone to tell them it's going to be okay.",xytn6s
This is fake. Russians don't queue.,xytn6s
"Let’s see, we need bread milk and an s-400",xytn6s
I need teepee for my bunghole.,xytn6s
Surprised that they have actual supermarkets over there.,xytn6s
"Such toilet roll, much riches",xytn6s
When was video taken???,xytn6s
Vodka isle is no doubt empty.,xytn6s
No panic yet,xytn6s
They seem to have plenty of toilet paper still…,xytn6s
I often wonder what stance the people of Crimea take on the war or about being annexed by Russia.  Are they waiting for Ukraine to come and rescue them? Did they actually want Russia to annex them?  Are they angry Ukrainians basically just ran away and surrendered Crimea more or less without a fight?,xytn6s
Give it a couple of days before reality sinks in ! Then the mass panic will happen at food store . Slava Ukraini,xytn6s
Looks like they are going all in on toilet paper too.,xytn6s
All going according to plan,xytn6s
I'm looking at Russians here that are occupying Crimea?,xytn6s
"No supermarket but military store of toiletpaper...
Full attack!
🤔",xytn6s
Welcome to the party,xytn6s
Why are still so many European brands available there? In particular Italian one ☝️ I spot Nutella and Barilla in the shopping car at 0:23,xytn6s
"There would be more, but the rest are stuck in the queue at the gas station😂",xytn6s
Regular day at costco,xytn6s
Russian army could learn some logistics from this supermarket.,xytn6s
Line is always this long,xytn6s
"Well they seem to have a lot of toilet paper, so the only thing they are ready for is another covid wave.",xytn6s
Look at all those genocide lovers. Fuck them all,xytn6s
Reminds me of Florida just before the hurricane,xytn6s
That local like all my local supermarkets at 16:00 ?? Full shelfs aswell.,xytn6s
I mean the shelf’s are still full 🥹,xytn6s
Plenty of toilet paper. Might turn out useful soon...,xytn6s
I'm surprised at how well stocked this store is for being overrun by people shopping en masse. I'd expect bare shelves and people fighting.,xytn6s
"Is it Christmas???
Slava Ukraini 🙏🇺🇦",xytn6s
"These ppl are suck, deserve what they get",xytn6s

Fingers crossed both lines were damaged preventing immediate use.,xytly9
"Amazing how the explosion happened at the same time a fuel train was passing by.  Also, those bridges carried communication lines across it to.  So lots of things got hit in one blow!",xytly9
It looks proper fucked!,xytly9
"One well BBQ'd rail bridge, that will take some fixing depending on the damage to the underlying structure. 

It must have taken some skill to get that truck bomb there at the same time as the fuel train, I personally dont believe in coincidence, so it must have been planned.",xytly9
In some of the videos it looks like the train was stopped.,xytly9
"Now keep hitting it every time they send engineers to assess and repair it, leave them with nothing and nobody.",xytly9
Structural engineer here. The picture is a little blurry but the technical term if you want to learn more is the bridge went and fucked itself.,xytly9

There’s a place for them or especially dirt bikes. Earlier on in the war Ukrainians specifically asked to be supplied with dirt bikes. They are super fast and mobile. I think it was mostly the snipers that wanted them. Paint them all black and silence the mufflers and it could make a good retreat when leaving after the hunt..,xz0ene

Who cares what they talk about, they would never go neiter to war, nor to protest, just a bunch of braindead pigs in front of TV. One emperor dies, another will come - their mouth will jump cocks in no time whatsoever. That's precisely why you shouldn't be in love with a government, it's not a football team to stand behind at all times no matter what. No good or bad, just our side.",xyupd6
"""I'm demanding to destroy Kyiv and Lviv""

Yes, your army has attacked those two cities with Kalibr, and guess what, your sorry ass got kicked badly, Ruskies, badly. You're welcome to try again, IF you have sufficient supplies.",xyupd6

"It's a pathetic coping mechanism by Russians. They can't deal with the reality of getting beaten by Ukraine, so they live with the delusion that they haven't really been trying yet.  Tens of thousands of their soldiers killed, massive loss of equipment, billions of dollars worth of missiles used, and the depletion of their army to such an extent that they had to institute a draft to delay an outright collapse of the Russian military, but Russians believe that they are going to kick the entire western world's ass whenever they really start trying.  This is closely related to an ambiguous conspiracy theory in Russia that ""elites"" have prevented Russia from actually trying to win.",xyqqth
"Dear Russians.  What 60,000 dead and wounded aren’t enough for you.",xyqqth
"It's all too easy to support a stupid war when other people's blood is being spilled. I want to see these bastards dying on the front, blown up by Ukrainian drones! Russian bastards!",xyqqth
"This is the perfect example of psychological grooming since the 2nd World War.

"When will these morons stop being actual pure bread nazis calling for more genocide.  How moronic do you have to be to support literally calling for MORE.   It's hard to even believe these are real ppl.  The outrage they show over one or death's yet have no issue with the 100,000 + Russia has lightly intentionally slaughtered is mind blowing.  If this was Ukraine, which I think it was, they take no pleasure in killing innocent people.  They don't commit acts of terrorism.  Their hits have military value and yes, we can all say it's sad that one is 2 died, but Ukeaine would take the time and care to actually try to do it when no one was on the bridge.  We all know this.  Had they been able to pause time and just take out the bridge they would. It's unfortunate but to twist it the way these loses do is just typical.  Irs funny though since hitler already is effectively shutting them up bc he says it wasn't Ukraine lol.",xyqqth
They cry for blood until they start smelling it. This results in Russia being the only country in the world in which people are fleeing because it invaded another country.,xyqqth
Can anyone see what Russians are actually saying on Telegram? What channels do you look at?,xyqqth
….and the laughter erupts! Nobody wants a war with Ukraine other than their silly leader,xyqqth
Lol fool Ukrainians are only fighting this hard because they view it as a genocide against their everything. It's not enough to kill off towns of people as you go but to attack their culture to try and tell a people they've never existed. They say time in again it doesn't matter nuke or not whether they die by sword or flame... They only care for our sake the NATO/OSAN.,xyqqth
Uhhh...  Because of the bridge?  Da fuq,xyqqth

"Germany alone has an economy twice that of Russia. If France, Britain, the US, Germany and Italy put their heads together, Europe will be warm.",xyqqth

This is a cold and dark years for ruzzia only. Flower will bloom and sun will shine in Ukraine. Europe and the rest of the world if much better without ruzzia.,xyqqth
They're talking like russia has been using 10% of its total power,xyqqth
"Yeah, it will fun times for RuZZian ppl watching their ""country"" getting hammered by NATO in less than a day, then what?, NATO just disposed of their ""armed forces"" and left them to clean the mess, nope, I don't c NATO running to the streets of MoZZcow, they will simply take down every military facility and unit, airbase, and navy base, nukes?, do u really believe NATO hasn't been keeping tabs on those since November last year or even much much before?, what will the MoZZcovites gonna do when they realize there's no armed forces to fight yet NATO is not invading them?, welp, Vova's lies will come down crushing their entire existence n their society will crumble, like in 1917, then 1991, but now many small countries will just stay away from MoZZcow, is the end of RuZZia.",xyqqth
"“Oh yeah. russia is pissed now!” 

Who the hell cares? It looks as if they have been half-assing the war so far, but it only looks that way. This was the best they could do. What are they gonna do now that they’re supposedly angry? Suck even more? Because that’s about all they’re good at.",xyqqth
"Wow, I can’t believe that there was I time that I respected Russian culture.",xyqqth
All of this is Russia and Putin’s fault. Point the fingers at them. None of the outrage should be directed at the Ukrainians.,xyqqth

The shockwave sort of envelops the roadway down to the waterlevel, and honestly the explosion seems to be originating before the truck(on our side that is).

Special focus on the Civil War after WW1 and the relationship between the Soviet Union and the third Reich.

Indeed the master plan was to split Europe between the Nazis and the Soviets.

Goebbels said the difference between Hitler Germany and Soviet Russia is very slight.

The whole of Hitlers ideology is based on Marxism.

Checking the slope of that road down to the lowest point that trucked detonated at the low point. Absolutely the perfect spot to direct as much force of the blast against the road which pushed in opposite directions ripping that road apart. The blast wave (pressure) would blast that sloped road with maximum opposite directions of force. The road 50ft in front of the truck is being forced forward and the upslope behind thr vehicle goes backwards. Damn smart to maximize damage. My guess also why it appears so much of the road remained intact almost like it simply popped out of place.,xylh5y

Casualties of a senseless war",xylh5y

I’m not seeing this truck bomb,xylh5y
"I don’t understand. The Russians say that they’ve found the truck responsible and have released footage of it passing through the checkpoint. So a few things, there were civilians on this bridge at the time of explosion that were probably caught up in it. Also, the none of the trucks in this footage are stopped, so that would mean the person in the truck that blew up the bridge would have been still inside. So a suicide bomber took out a bridge? 

Sorry, I highly doubt that Ukraine does things this way. I don’t know how they did it, but they placed explosives there without anyone noticing beforehand and detonated (which sucks that there were people driving across the bridge). Not a fucking suicide bomber wtf.",xylh5y

There is nothing exotic or impossible to replace built into it all the drawings and capabilities to manufacture the items needed already exist. On a construction point all I would be waiting for is how the engenders want the piers repaired, but even that is not a big or complex job its a repair to the top not a replacement.",xz1j4v

Honestly they lie like insane people all the time, they will rather be dead that accept this. If there wasn't a visible fire and explosion they would deny it ever happened.

""In connection with the carried out attack by Ukraine on the “Crimean Bridge”, the reshuffles planned for several weeks in the Ministry of Defense, which were supposed to end next week, were shifted, the result was the resignation of Shoigu and Gerasimov.

Of the replacements for the positions of Minister of Defense and Chief of the General Staff of the Russian Defense Ministry, Dyumin, Matovnikov, Yevkurov and Tsalikov were considered.

The main bet was made on the alignment: Dyumin - Minister of Defense, Matovnikov - Chief of the General Staff. Both personalities have good reviews from the officers of the General Staff, in particular the Special Operations Forces. Tsalikov was removed from the discussion due to the lack of managerial and command experience, and was also negatively recommended by a ""note"" through the state security agencies due to questions about the state and income of both himself and his family.""",xyurzk

While not as obviously damaged, other traffic lane is probably toast too.",xylxhw
Now Russians have a direct route to go pay respects to the Moskva.,xylxhw
"somehow there seem to be two damage patterns, the first one is parallel to the train and the second one is on a slope to the arch bridge, in any case the bridge is gone and material now has to be transported by ship, NEPTUN i hear you already",xylxhw
Happy birthday Putin ya cunt,xylxhw
"3 deck spans gone and the rest may have shifted on their bearings that could take some time to fix, I HIMARS or two would put the other deck out of action 

What damage has been done to the rail link will be interesting as well

EITHER this is a bad accident OR Ukraine is about to retake Crimea.",xylxhw
Russians: You broke our bridge/supply line!  Ukraine: Oh yeah? Why don't ya Crimea river!?!,xylxhw
What a wonderful way to wake up!,xylxhw
HIMARS on the unexploded fuel tanks NOW please and thank you,xylxhw
"Great pictures.

Next attack is hopefully going to see rail and second road link blown to bits",xylxhw
Is there something to prevent those tankers from exploding?,xylxhw
Just needs some duct tape!,xylxhw
"It's just made getting supplies, military, or other into Crimea a heck of a lot harder! Slava Ukraini!",xylxhw

"The kremlin has just announced the bridge is partially reopen for light traffic, all is well folks, carry on with your commute.",xylxhw
Hit it again,xylxhw
"I don't like to spoil the party, but something failed in the attack. Apparently, the intent was to strike the two road directions sections of the bridge while the fuel train was passing. Since there is no debris on top of the bridge I assume it was caused by two explosion under the bridge, probably by surfacing underwater unmanned vehicles.",xylxhw
Looks better than I thought,xylxhw
"I seem more tanker cars, hit it again.",xylxhw
"Interesting that random people have total access to this destroyed bridge, taking photos and videos unhindered. Putin is fast losing whatever grip he had left. Happy Birthday Vlad.",xylxhw
Yeah the video of the blast had a bunch of thermite looking stuff float down on the fuel train. White phosphorus maybe,xylxhw
"So are the Russians still gonna use the bridge? I mean, sure theirs damage but there’s still a road",xylxhw
Interesting.  Look and see that the roadway has been lifted off the piling truss and pushed off to the right.  A truck bomb on the roadway would not do that - the shock wave would be upward and to the sides.  It would push directly down on the span and not lift it.  Only a shock wave from beneath the span could actually lift the roadway.,xylxhw
"I don’t know, the trusses of train bridge look intact with superficial damage and columns are intact…
I recommend hitting it again for good measure, the ‘ol double tap
Slava Ukraini 🫡🇺🇦",xylxhw
It looks like they could just put a cross over between the two road sections.,xylxhw
That was a bigger explosion than it looked on the camera,xylxhw

I'm supprised they are just letting people wander around and film it. Purely from a safety perspective that shit should be locked down.,xylxhw

A strong himars gust of wind WILL finish it OFF..

Dunno how sound that other roadway is, they might be able to salvage it for some amount of one-way traffic, depending on how much damage it has.

The lightpoles are still standing(note even the ones on the collapsed road segments) and the barriers are in good shape. Continuing on this, I’m pretty sure part of the operation was unsuccesful. Honestly I reckon they planned to sabotage all three parts of the bridge, both roadways and the railway, but the last two failed to do it’s work.

"What kind of explosive do you guys reckon would act in this way? The fireball seems massive. I would assume that you would not want to expend explosive energi to make a huge firestorm, but rather make immense pressure if your main objective is to destroy the bridge?

/100% explosives noob",xylenq
Here's my question: was this an actual VBIED/suicide bomber? Seems like an unusual tactic/MO for Ukraine. Could this have been a Russian partisan driver that didn't know what was in his trailer? That would be my guess but I'm sitting here wasting time on Reddit and not attending high level military briefings. What do y'all think?,xylenq
Look under the bridge before the explosion. Looks like a boats bow wave to me and its definitely just before the explosion,xylenq
Russia wants to play 'silly buggers' game.....this is what you get! (Australian reference) Slava Ukraine and its Allies!,xylenq
I think something got under the bridge and the suicide truck is a red herring. There is what looks like a boat wake right before the explosion and the epicenter of the explosion doesn't seems to be from the truck.,xylenq
"Watch under the bridge just before the explosion. A wave appears immediately before but it looks very much like a bow wave from a boat of some kind that suddenly stopping.

Assuming Ukraine haven't sent a suicide bomber in a truck to do it an unmanned boat of some description with an extremely low profile could slip past any radar or patrols fairly easily.

Of course the wave could just be a wave and the timing a coincidence",xylenq
You can actually see the bow of a water vessel moving into view from right to left just as the explosion occurs right above it.,xylenq
"At the moment of the explosion and milliseconds following it, you see the point of the explosion be set where the truck was and it looks like that point of the explosion moves at the same rate of speed as the truck slightly forward. To me it verifies that it was a truck bomb. So my question is, what will RT lie about it being? Also great way to save a HIMARS rocket or two. Slava Ukraine and rest in peace to the hero who probably and single-handedly change the course of the southern front. By change the course of the southern front I mean make it even more difficult for Russia to fight it. Since Ukraine is already doing a great job at fighting it.",xylenq

This means Russian forces retreating from Kherson are less likely to move south than they are to move east, which is what Ukraine wants.

"Considering that orange yellow fire from the fuel cart , that means roughly 2000 degrees Fahrenheit that’s it’s burning at, meaning the concrete might be able to explode and start to crack. That whole section of rail might be out for a very long time if there’s structural damage spanning that wide of an amount.",xyivxr

From the live video and phone video of someone in a car when it happened.. it looked like an explosion on the road bridge which “just happened” to have a fuel tanker next to it which would have taken shrapnel and fire.,xyivxr
"second lane looks damaged but still driveable. Which, i guess, was intentional so that civilians and withdrawing troops are able to run if need be. Those that are trapped and have no choice but to fight till death are more dangerous.",xyivxr
"Oh, so a very, very, very, very unfortunate accident - A one in a Billion, Billion, Billion chance and nothing to do with  Putin's ""Special Operation"" (War) with Ukraine.",xyivxr
"The spans on both bridges are perhaps 40 metres (130 feet), relatively short for engineers to construct temporary, steel, truss-girders across and reopen both lines. Sorry for the bad news......I wish the whole bridge was gone.",xyivxr
"Although moot, I doubt the Ukrainians were behind this. They would have wanted both bridges blasted, and many more spans down. Looking at the security vid, this may have been a suicide bomber.",xyivxr
The train did not cause the bridge to fall.  You would see more structural damage on the RR bridge than the roadway bridge.  It appears that two tank cars caught fire as result of the blast.,xyivxr
"Crazy that people will stop and start filming this instead of hauling ass out of there.  Hey, there's a train on fire full of fuel and ammunition... what could go wrong?  I'll just keep filming...",xyivxr
"Not knowing enough about the bridge and railways of Russian / Crimea...

How would Ukrainians have arranged the train to be full of fuel and sent off in the direction of Russia?",xyivxr

"A few things to note: melted metal guardrail is visible at the start of the video.

There are two sets of tracks on this line.

Rail bridges often do have gravel, when there is a full rail bed and not just a steel skeleton. The gravel soaks up the oils and makes it so maintenance workers can walk around normally. Where I live, all the rail bridges that are not metal skeletons have the exact same amount of gravel on the bridge as in neighboring areas, it is a continuous surface. (*this doesn't apply to urban passenger light-rail, of course)

If the structure is damaged and they use it anyway, it could take days or weeks for further cracks to appear at which time it would either fall into the water, or they might notice and stop using it. For the people deciding if it is usable or not, the Russian preference is usually just to say ""Go!"" and if it collapses, blame the explosion not the inspection. Decision-makers seem to have so little technical knowledge about the thing they're overseeing that few people might even know it wasn't a normal risk. If they say don't use it, and somebody else says do use it, and they try it and it lasts a week and falls over, they might still think it proves the ""use it"" person right.",xz0nw1
Wait till daylight it will be clear enough then whether the trains are running,xz0nw1
"Did anyone confirmed it really went through the bridge? 

I find it rather suspicious they have it repaired so fast. Just checking for damage  of rails and construction should take at least a day. 

Smells fake AF, all things considering.",xz0nw1
Typical Russian lies.,xz0nw1
They never ever gonna drive no train full of tanks or any other military vehicles to crimea on that bridge. Just give up and realize your country is fucked. Crimea is ukraine 🇺🇦Slava Ukraini🇺🇦,xz0nw1
"I hooe this is fake but the rail-part was not hit. Only some busted carts and some damaged rail.

I hope they can brake the phylons and send it all to the bottom of the sea.",xz0nw1
"Sorry to disappoint, but that's not a bridge. That is gravel. There's no gravel on that bridge.",xz0nw1
Bullshit. Who moved the burning train?,xz0nw1
"Or ruzzia runs a train on some track somewhere.
No evidence that this is even near the bridge let alone on it",xz0nw1
"Thats a bullshit video. I mean come on... if you post a video about the bridge, the train should at minimum be on a bridge to make is convincing",xz0nw1
Well Satellite imagery as of a couple of hours ago still had all the core rail cars on the bridge as some of them are still smoking.  So to say I am skeptical of this video is the understatement of the century.  Not to mention the immediate structure below the hottest point had significant evidence of buckling that cannot be repaired so easily.  I could go on but the essence is that whatever this video may be it is not the damaged section of the rail track.,xz0nw1
Eh even if they DID fix it already!! I'm sure nobody in Kyiv thought they were gonna shut everything down the first time out. But now Vlad's got ANOTHER headache to worry about until the next time!,xz0nw1
"Notice this was filmed at night.  Also, the rails of the Crimean bridge looks nothing like the ones they are showing here.",xz0nw1
"It seems obvious to me, the speed for which that bridge was repaired, it is very important to russia’s war effort.

In other words, it needs to be obliterated",xz0nw1
"If it’s genuine, then it’s very impressive repair work. Network Rail would take 3 months to do that and that’s without the risk of being bombed.",xz0nw1
They don’t put ballast on railway bridge.,xz0nw1
Where is the bridge?,xz0nw1
Cargo 200,xz0nw1
"It's their right to do it...yeah right.
🤣",xz0nw1
"Rybar is not very optimistic about the repair:

'Under the most optimistic scenario, traffic on the bridge can be fully restored in four to five weeks.  
In fact, most likely, the terms will be somewhat longer. But if the work is given top priority, and the stand for the manufacture of spans has not been dismantled since 2018, then the restoration will hardly exceed two to three months.""",xz0nw1
Let Putin be the conductor!,xz0nw1
Russia has a completely different idea of danger.,xz0nw1
"They put out the fires; removed the damaged cars; repaired the infrastructure; and replaced the damaged rails, sleepers, and signal paths; over sea waters in 24hrs?

Idunno... I don't see Russia having the required technical capacity... Where did you get this headline?",xz0nw1
Looking at satellite photos there are 2 rail lines on the bridge so trains can go either direction. Most likely the one that the fuel cars were on is screwed for the near future but they don’t need to remove those cars to drive another train past it. It will complicate and slow train logistics (and idk if they are game to try it loaded with 50 tonne tanks) but won’t completely block rail transport for now.,xz0nw1
"""Hey guys...maybe we cant win a war in couple of days bu we can repair rails in just one or two... behoooold our mighty power...""",xz0nw1
Probably time for round two!,xz0nw1
Gonna have to hit it again I guess.,xz0nw1
If only they were as efficient installing plumbing and toilets in their own country ..,xz0nw1

"Considering that orange yellow fire from the fuel cart , that means roughly 2000 degrees Fahrenheit that’s it’s burning at, meaning the concrete might be able to explode and start to crack. That whole section of rail might be out for a very long time if there’s structural damage spanning that wide of an amount.",xyj8xq
"Either its pure Luck or a superb hit but managing do destroy a entire lane AND the rails where a fuel train was on it is one of the best results you could expect. Too Bad the inner lane is still standing but that was a Hell of a hit ! And maybe not the last...

I am waiting for the details of this operation because i dont Know it the truck was the weapon or if it was a strike for something else. If the truck came from russian side why they let it pass with his cargo ? Was it a suicide bomber inside the truck ? So many questions that will have to wait... 



But for now its a 15/20 with 2 bonus points for the date, a solid 17/20 for Ukraine today !",xyj8xq

"My thought is that Ukrainian sentences are too low.  I like American sentences, which are generally measured in decades for serious violent crimes.  I'm Canadian.  We recently had a Supreme Court of Canada decision which found that consecutive sentences of life imprisonment for first degree murder, with no parole eligibility for 25 years, are unconstitutional.  The sentences must be concurrent.  In other words, every murder after the first is a freebie (arising from the same event).  A guy in Toronto mowed down 8-10 people with his car 2 years ago.  He can only get 25 years parole ineligibility -- maximum.
The above Ukrainian penalty for treason during wartime of 15 years is way too low.  Ukraine should adopt American sentences  .... at least until the European Court of Human Rights intervenes.",xygodi

"My deepest, most profound respect for this Ukrainian soldier. Undoubtedly he’s seen some fucked up shit but he retained enough humanity to work to rescue this asshole when the rest of his unit left him for dead. Glad to see his cynicism is also strong",xxwexq
The way he put the vest over his face and then punched him was his only saving grace of not blowing this dudes head clean off from the anger he is feeling,xxwexq
*bonk*,xxwexq
"""We are not like you shitheads"" is some righteous shit to say to a terrorist invader under any circumstances.  


Kudos to that soldier, SLAVA UKRAINI",xxwexq
[deleted],xxwexq
"The level of humanity shown here is incredible, to take the time and help an enemy combatant that has treated your countrymen so savagely and would have killed you given the chance is just incredible to me. I really don't know if I'm man enough to do what he did. Part of me wants to say that the rage I felt would make me kill him but the truth is I don't think I could do that either.",xxwexq
Would be interesting to know if they got him out alive finally,xxwexq
"The way he insists that he's a ""doctor"" all dressed up in tankist uniform...basically asking that already pissed-off Ukrainian soldier to bash his head in. Well, it's also true that he did say ""finish me off"" at the beginning, but still...keep your fucking mouth shut...",xxwexq
"Excellent and beautiful humanity, unlike some people here wishing for a violent and cruel outcome, this guy can be exchanged for a couple or one of Ukrainian POWS, are we forgetting? 

I /do/ somewhat believe he is a medic, we should not be the judge and assume his intentions. This is just wholesome and funny between two enemies, one helping his enemy putting aside their differences. Risking it all to get him out, just incredible about how us humans can be when we do not lose our self control and become a monster that only seeks blood and gore. 

Now this Russian soldier has a story to tell when he has kids. I now will write another ww2 story like I did on the original post.

An American soldier had survived, he was a paratrooper and wounded badly by artillery when rescued by a group of Wehrmacht soldiers. On adrenaline and pain, he begged them to kill him, he didn’t want to be their prisoner, but they refused. Helped him and in the morning told him they wanted to be his prisoner instead. Humanity goes a long way, do not let war change you into a murderer. You’re not a hero or winning any glory killing another human being who is wounded or just in general. 

The banter and the soft hit is just too funny, reminds me of brothers fighting and getting the last word. Definitely the Ukrainian soldier is way better (better than most people here) for saving him, but just knowing if his comrades were there they’d probably kill him",xxwexq
"> Kastroma? What the fuck are you doing here?

Should be
""Kastroma? Then why are you in my Kupyansk?""",xxwexq
""" We are not like you shitheads"" - Great line.",xxwexq
"Its so good that they censored the word ass...  
We wouldn't want a little kid watching people die learn foul language",xxwexq
"Man...so desperate...but, too late.",xxwexq
"He could have a doctorate in many things and just thrown into this mess without the idiot authorities asking him what he did. To the Russians, he is a body. Hopefully they were able to save his life and IF he has some kind of MEDICAL doctor degree he can VOLUNTEER to help the medical staff in Ukraine. But if he has a Doctorate in Ancient Sumerian Lit or some such shit...oh well.",xxwexq
"I posted this as a response to someone else but there’s no reason to doubt the Russian. 

The Red Cross is used when you have no organic weapons on the Stryker, or other vehicle. But the medics still have their rifles, which are considered self defence and protected under the cross. 

If the vehicle gets offensive armament, then you turn the crosses in. They have metal plates that allow you to hide them, because you lose right to use the cross when it’s an offensive vehicle.

I’ve been, as a medic, in an .50 cal armed stryker with a doctor driving it and a nurse being on the gun controls. So your mileage varies. I have no reason to doubt this Russian.",xxwexq
He asks for mercy kill; he must think that death is better then being captured. Probably did/saw some bad things to POW's to have that type of mindset. Massive respect for the Ukrainians here.,xxwexq
You don't learn mercy and empathy in Heaven. You learn it in Hell.,xxwexq
Did they manage to free him and get him shipped off to a field hospital or was it all in vain in the end? Well done to the Ukraine army for helping out these guys,xxwexq
OP how did you get subtitles? I have videos to post but I don’t have English subtitles.,xxwexq
If the roles were reversed this would have ended differently  certain,xxwexq
How’d he end up sat on it as it’s crashed through a wall? I don’t get it. Why didn’t he jump off before it hit?,xxwexq
"Damnit Jim, I’m a doctor not a orc!",xxwexq
He deservedly gets a smack on the head for showing disrespect (and also being part of the group that tried to capture Kyiv). The cheeky bastard is lucky it's Ukrainians he's fighting and not the Free Syrians. They would have finished him off for sure!,xxwexq
"“We’re not like you sh!theads” is one of the best quotes to emerge from this war, up there with “Russian warship go f*ck yourself” and “I need ammunition, not a ride”.",xxwexq
"Maybe I'm wrong but it actually comes across to me like this murderous man (the Russian, just to be clear) believes his own schtick about not being there to hurt anyone. I don't know. I wonder if he made it out of that pile.

Also: wow, trying to save someone who you are rightly so disgusted by and angry at is incredible. I hope that he gets some recognition.",xxwexq
"In my opinion. More that saving another human being he is saving himself keeping his humanity intact. When the war is over it will matter to him, knowing he could easily walked away, without any judgement, but he chose not to. Respect.",xxwexq
The way he flips his ballistic vest over his face and gives it a whack 😂,xxwexq
Wasn’t there this recorded call where the guys says he is a medic and they put him at the front?,xxwexq
That is fucked,xxwexq

This is the whole point of this war, I think.

However this ends, Putler has lied like hell to his people and they've willingly lapped it up.  But they certainly have repeated history and restored their clay-footed reputation.

Ukrainian captors are too trusting here allowing these orcs free movement of their hands tied in front of their bodies. The blindfolds serve no purpose if they can easily shift them around. A lot more bad things can happen by making it too easy for them to untie each other and/or over power their captors. Some of them don't have their hands tied.,xy37fh

The deceased are wearing some type of shoes and not combat boots. Nearly every photo and video I have seen of the Foreign Legion shows them wearing some type of advanced hiking boot or combat boots.

Any of these replacements do not solve or change the situation currently at play.  There would need to be a massive e shift politically from the population and a major internal disturbance for a change in Ukraine.,xyk4dm

At some point it is likely that there will have to be negotiations. Not about Ukraine land but most likely about trying to difuse the situation once Ukrainian land is got back. 

When putin says he is not bluffing about using tactical nukes in Ukraine maybe he is telling the truth. I completely agree that Ukraine and the west should not buckle under threats. I'm just saying at some point the situation needs to be calmed and hoping that Putin will go and then it will open that door is wishful thinking.",xyk4dm

To win one hundred victories in one hundred battles is not the acme of skill. To subdue the enemy without fighting is the acme of skill.",xxtuhm

Surrender Hotline. Love it!,xxtuhm
"This is so smart on so many levels. 1) Fewer people shooting at Ukrainians. 2) PR. The Ukrainians end up looking like they treated Russian soldiers better than the Russians did. This could have long-lasting ramifications after the war, whenever that it is.",xxtuhm
"Ukrainians are awesome people, when this war is over I'm coming Ukraine to spend lots of money",xxtuhm

"This is amazing, its crazy how war, especially this one, changes so much",xxtuhm
"The Ukrainians , are genuinely proving themselves to be some smart dudes. 

This stuff needs to be flooded into all media outlets and the web, show the Russians they’ll be treated respectfully. 

Works 2 fold in the sense of hopefully they’ll surrender but they’ll also be shown how they’ve been living in the Stone Age by comparison",xxtuhm
Never under estimate the Ukrainian 's intelligence. Putin failed to recognize this. He is paying the price ! Slava Ukraini,xxtuhm
Very kind of them,xxtuhm
"Ukraine continues to impress.

I'm glad Russian conscripts are able to get out.  I'm glad Ukraine has the will to not kill every invader in their country they don't have to.",xxtuhm
"This is an amazingly badass idea when you think about it. 

1) It saves lives
2) It takes enemy soldiers off the battlefield
3) It destabilizes Putin’s regime a bit in the longer term since Ukraine is following Geneva conventions and they are allowing them to call home
4) It helps assure Ukraine of the moral high ground in the eyes of Russian soldiers, which has to be yet another hit to their morale.

The only cost to Ukraine is the 3 meals a day and the prison guards needed to watch the Russians. If they do this right, it could be like the German POWs in WWII who fell in love with the country in which they were housed as prisoners and moved back there when hostilities ceased.

Meanwhile Russia’s long term prospects dim even further due to brain-drain, lower birth rate, potential labor shortages and fallen international reputation.",xxtuhm
"surely the orcs will try to bait AFU somehow? or spam the line 24/7? I hope this will work out, may thousands of conscripts never fire a single round!",xxtuhm
They should have some of the previous guys (who surrendered before) manning the phones to talk to the new guys who want to surrender now. Can't think of a more effective way to re-assure them against the propaganda horror stories they've no doubt been told.,xxtuhm
that is so cool,xxtuhm

Not sure if you want to offer them asylum. Too much Russian influence is what started this mess to begin with.,xxtuhm
"Absolutely.  And the more videos demonstrating the process, the better. The rate tge Orcs are going, most of their army will probably thrown down the weapons and go into captivity.",xxtuhm
"I’m glad things like this exist, many young men will be spared the grinder.",xxtuhm
"When the enemy you’re fighting against cares more about your wellbeing than the people who sent you to fight them…

Russia doesn’t deserve the good natured treatment they are receiving but I guess that what separates the wheat from the chaff.",xxtuhm
This is the sort of info you need to get to all Russian conscripts/army regulars. They’ve most likely been so brain washed by propaganda of mutilation and torture that they need to see and hear that isn’t the case.,xxtuhm
Russia going to try and sneak in some spies for sure.,xxtuhm

"I know we’re months into this war, and Russia deserves everything coming to it, but I can still hardly believe what I’m seeing. 

It’s 2022, almost 2023, not only are we not at the end of it, we don’t know what’s coming. Is anyone else going to enter the fight? Will Russia give up, will putin get taken out?

What about the pipeline, is the world going to pretend that didn’t happen, or is NATO going to be pulled into it?

‘Never again?’ I wish.",xy9kp1

"One of the reasons why Starlink is difficult to jam is because the satellites travel very fast across the sky, being in low-earth orbit, and there are so many of them (3000+ and increasing every week with each Falcon 9 rocket launch placing 50+ more into orbit).

At 500km altitude and approx. 7.5 km/s speed, Each Starlink satellite takes about 2 minutes to pass overhead from horizon to horizon.  For that Tirada-2 jamming system to jam a Starlink satellite, it would have to be able to follow that satellite across the sky as it passes overhead then quickly switch to the next one coming into view.  And if there are multiple Starlink satellites passing overhead, that one Tirada-2 system can't jam them all (the photos I've seen of the Tirada-2 vehicle appears to use a parabolic antenna rather than a phased array).

I doubt the frontline Starlink outages are due to the Tirada-2 system.  Otherwise users further behind the lines in friendly territory sharing bandwidth with that same satellite passing overhead would report an outage too, but only those at the frontlines are reporting outages.",xyb462

write themselves",xxu3ux
I feel sorry for the pigs,xxu3ux
What is their obsession with washing machines? Have they never seen one in russia or something,xxu3ux
"After the liberation of Lyubimivka in the Kherson region, SBU servicemen began checking the abandoned positions of the so-called ""second army of the world"". They found that the Russian occupiers shared a table and slept with pigs.
But these were not all the finds.  Stolen washing machines stood among the dirt and stench...",xxu3ux
Hahahaha I didn’t believe it until I seen the washing machine,xxu3ux
Imagine the smell of the pigs now after they’ve shared living space with Russian soldiers.,xxu3ux
Can you imagine sleeping in that pen that has been sprayed with pig shit all over the place. And eating there too.,xxu3ux
Like home,xxu3ux
Orks and pigs,xxu3ux
It must have come naturally to them.,xxu3ux
"It's a great day when you can use the insult ""pig fucker"" legitimately!",xxu3ux
"You just can't make this shit up! The orcs lived in a pigpen and had a fucking stolen washing machine in there. 😆

You just can’t make this up 😂,xxu3ux

That's why I don't have to kill poor Ukraininas. So basically if Putin gave them job and secured them proper paycheck they would never join this war. So the reason is Putin and russian government. Keep them poor and uneducated then treat them like pigs.",xxu3ux
Ruzzians can’t be separated with their looted washing machines lol,xxu3ux
The pigs tearfully thanked the Ukrainian soldiers for removing the Orcs.  They couldn't stand the stench and filth any longer,xxu3ux
They're gonna have to fumigate that place...,xxu3ux
Russians definitely know how to camouflage,xxu3ux
"From now on, when FPS games are made involving Russian troops. Instead of using ""wooden crates"" like CS does as environment pieces, game producers must now use washing machines..",xxu3ux

"I'm speechless! Russia is losing this war... when boiled down to basic, they are terrible managers. They fail to supply their soldiers with everything. Very likely sufficient monies have been supplied but much of that does not filter past the higher ranks. Everyone gets their cut. Those with no power get table scraps. Pig pens is a sign the officers of this unit are taking too big a piece of the pie. Most likely they get an allowance, per man/per night. Anything they don't spend they keep. These guys may survive this war. Their commanders appear to be crafty fellows.",xxu3ux

"Reports are that a drone attack destroyed two Russia strategic bombers TU23m3 at an airfield 200km behind the border. 

I think a much bigger loss than the two bombers is the publication of the fact that drones can fly 140 miles from a warzone, into Russia, and strike a air base unmolseted. This isn’t shitty surface to air defense. It’s the absence of surface to air defense.

"""One of the Russians who flew to Israel made a brawl in the airport premises. Apparently, he did not have the necessary documents and refused to follow the employees. In the video, you can hear the Russian saying that he will not go anywhere.  
The Israelis in Russian tried to make it clear to a tourist from Russia,  
that he will be treated normally, but he must stop resisting. This is followed by a series of several blows and the Russians were simply taken by the legs and taken out of the room.""",xxwh57
"How can he be an occupier if he **escaped** mobilization? As I understand this, he ran so that he would not become one.",xxwh57
Occupier that tries to run away from the draft? How did he occupy anything if he hasn’t even been drafted yet?,xxwh57
"so is Israel deporting draft dodgers back to Russia? what's the story, here?",xxwh57
"your title makes no sense. you know, google translate is free",xxwh57
but there‘s no proof he supported the war. or do you have more details?,xxwh57
"So send him back to be a killer..That isn't helping anyone especially Ukraine. Hopefully there is more to this than just forcing a human being back to a country that will make him kill in another country.

Side note, that's the hardest I've seen a Russian fight all war.",xxwh57
Israel can't exactly support people trying to evade compulsory military service without appearing to be massive hypocrites.,xxwh57
"I think op meant to say a Russian (“occupier” in general from Ukrainian’s perspective. Implying op could be an Ukrainian) who escaped from mobilization, resisting being sent home.",xxwh57
"Looks like a straight deportation, as for what, we can only guess, they don’t screw about there tho.",xxwh57
"I looked into the source. Israel welcomes Russian citizens with a right and intention to repatriate. There is a lot of them, practically all Russian Jews. They currently don't allow Russian tourists in without Visa. No, they do not send all drafted back home, no country gives a fuck whether anybody got a conscription paper in their mailbox.",xxwh57
Warning: dead men walking,xxwh57
"This is a very bad approach. Why not instead of sending back those who escaped the mobilization and stopping others from escaping mobilization, they put them in isolation camps. The war wont end if Putin have warm bodies to send to the frontlines.",xxwh57
Ben Gurion...that makes no sense?,xxwh57
"Why would anyone send him back 
When should help those people 
Not all Russians are bad",xxwh57
Reading some of these comments here makes me sick to the stomach. How can you applaud people being send to death. You seem to have the same thinking as the Russians who support the war.,xxwh57
That's the spirit! More of these to the front!,xxwh57
"I do feel the tiniest bit of pity for him; but overwhelmingly there’s more disdain- many Russians (admittedly not all) didn’t oppose the war, they just opposed dying in the war. This vatnik seems like he wasn’t smart enough to leave when the war started but he was at least smart enough to try to leave before being mobilized. Too bad he’s probably still going to fertilize some patch of sunflowers.",xxwh57
Off to the sunflower fields young man.,xxwh57
Not a great fan of Israeli Jews. They have made their hard line ultra racist bed and they can lay in it as far as I'm concerned. Wouldn't give any of them refuge in my home if the Arabs drove them all into the sea one day.,xxwh57

"A lot different than Russian ""trench-mates.""",xxlsoi
"Biases aside, the Ukrainians sure seem to be weathering their situation far better than their opponents. Despite their circumstances, they still find time to laugh, joke, dance, etc. 

The Irish are known for their sunny disposition, even in poor circumstances, so much so that there exists the phrase ""Irish diplomacy is the ability of telling someone to go to hell so he looks forward to the trip."" The Ukrainians seem to have a similar ability in war that even under awful circumstances, they haven't been fully robbed of their zeal or joy. It's beyond encouraging to not only watch these people stand up and fight, but to maintain their dignity and humanity while doing so.

idk why I read the last part as Trench-life matters,xxlsoi
"Once you have done everything you can to stay safe during shelling there is only one thing that decides the mental state of those going through it (somewhat simplified):

\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*

On an individual level - Does the personell feel it is important for them to be there?

\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*

If yes:

They are likely in a well functioning unit with a nation behind them in support. That unit is motivated and united around a common goal of equal importance to all. Meaning they have done what they can to survive and can much easier accept that they are in a very dangerous situation. And they feel bonded to their fellow fighters in a way commonly described as ""at least as strong as that between brothers"", not kind of like that - but in the most literal sence possible. Proof of which there are countless exemples. 

With that cohesion comes a strong motivation to be brave for eachother and a will to share risks for the good of everyones common goal. Generally these soldiers will go through anything and STILL come out in good psycological shape, even after extended periods of extreme situations. As long as that sence of doing something important remains even during these lottery life/death situations they will (generally) be ok. During and after.

&#x200B;

If however the answer is ""No!""

You still do what you can and end up in a similar hole in the ground to the one above. However, the same risk of getting a direct hit is in this trench mindboggingly terrifying. Faaaaar into a completelly unacceptable risk to be in!!! If YOU don't feel it is important for you to be there, then most likely it's the same for all. Meaning their side fight a war in which soldiers feel that win or loose, their lives wont be affected much either way. For such a soldier if kept in a state of constant high risk of dieing, there WILL be psycological scars or trauma affecting the rest of his life. One way or another, there will be. 

Without that shared sence of it being important enough for them to be there - there also wont form a brotherhood in the same sence as between the soldiers in trench 1. Instead individual soldiers in this trench see their own survival as the only goal of any real importance if you boil it down. Noone there will volontarily take on the slightest extra risk unless it directly serves that goal, and on that side the best person for any high risk situation is ALWAYS: 

Someone else!  

They will volonteer for nothing and always do as little as possible, even if they know someone else in their unit will face extra risks because of it. Most orders get questioned by someone. Until the punishments for not silently walking to your needless death, has made your own political leadership a greater danger to your future than the enemy soldiers are. Leaving only suicide and self mutilation viable means of self defence for most guys of poor, rural background, or from etnic minorities who lack representation in the corridors of power in Kremlin. 

""Front line infantry!"" 

""Why me? Why is it important enough for me to die for?"" 

All the people in a ""No!""-trench lacks a shared sence of necessity to bond them into true Brotherhood. and  no matter views, personlities etc are just in a hole with some people they've been forced to live and die with, or even for. In reality they have never heard or seen signs of anything in Ukraine that makes it worth it for them to die in this war. So I can guarantee that the psycological effects of this war on the soldiers fighting with or along the Russians is already a problem of huge concern to the Russian side.

&#x200B;

In the first trench, no matter the mix of different backgrounds, views and personalities: There is only one way to succeed with their common goal to win the war. Use resources in the most efficient way and always see that end result as more important than any individual person. If YOU are best suited for a job that needs to be done you will WANT to be the person doing it. So in that trench the soldiers see every other person they encounter out in public as a highly valued person for the Special WAR Operation. and a resource serving the same goal they themselves have. They of course value their own lives and feel fear same as anyone. It is however not the only life in the trench of GREAT importance to them nor is ANY one life , even their own, worth risking ultimate victory for. In such a trench a strong form of Brotherhood is generated automatically. 

&#x200B;

And once you are in a family, a real one, you're suddenly prepared to do WHATEVER it takes for your family to succeed. As long as the feeling of idoing something important, worth even dieing for, remain the  dominating feeling among people both fighting the war and on the home front it is MUUUUCH easier for the troops on that side to remain alive, effective and motivated over time, Functioning as a team first and as a group of individuals second - even during situations of extreme stress and fear fpr the soldiers. That gives a much better chance to keep absorbing information, reason logically with that info as base and adapt to new situations. Objective still in mind. EVEN if that enemy had already desintegrated into an ""All for himself!-situation.  sons own life in the Russian forces, once they get into REAL danger they loose all cohesion and what was a chain of command as well as their ability to function as a group fucused on the success of their mission - evaporate.

Usually from top -down. Leaving untrained and terrified conscripts alone to fight focused and functioning Ukrainian combat units....-while in a state of panic.

That of course cause mass casualties on the Russian side. And an ever more dysfunctional command structure as it is clear to the grunts that they are worth nothing even to their own commanders.

The clip above is a perfect representation of why Russia can't win this war. Why the regular army and Wagner don't see themselves as in the same army. Why troops don't trust their own officers, and why it takes threats of a decade in prison to get people to fight, and to get those who do to not surrender at the slightest sign of line collapse.

If you ask a person if he'd be ok with a random person having to go through a 50/50 chance of death for a nice car for free for instance, most people would do it.

But then change the rules suddenly and tell the same guy that it in fact wont be a random person who gets a coin toss for Life or Death, but his own kid and most people would trade places with that kid given the chance.

Knowing his kid is back on the menu should he not fullfill his duties, he won't have to be forced and will go in focused even. He'd be afraid but he'd also feel that it is of the utmost importance that HE is there doing whatever it takes for the mission to succeed.

So his kid wont have to anyway.

Failure is not an option, and he has to be brave. He WILL be brave.

&#x200B;

But...

If a bunch of random guys were suddenly picked off the street for no apparent reason and suddenly faced that coin toss without any thing to gain from going through with it and surviving... well:

That would cause minds to crack, or shut down from the terror and stress, more and more so as that coin toss situation drew closer. When about to be forced into that situation ""any second now now!"" - there would likely be strokes. And anyone surviving by luck do so with a 100% chance of now having PTSD.

All the while, that Dad facing the same risks brought his A-game and remained too focused to break down into a state where logic and reason can't be utilized.

He survived, with memories of a truly horriffic day!

It was however also the day he learned that with the right mindset you sometimes become a Superhero when you need it the most.

\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*

Is it important for me to be here?                   - If ""No"", Call that Ukrainian hotline, asap!

"Now this is humanity we needed, no one should be asking for violence. Russians are still human, like it or not. No one should be the judge and generalise them as all bad. The banter here is just funny yet so wholesome that this Ukrainian soldier had self control for his enemy, risking his life perhaps to save his enemy. That is amazing and so sweet, acting as if it could’ve been one of his own. Just proving how better he is ( and better than some of these people in these comments wishing he would’ve executed the Russian soldier —- completely forgetting he can be used to exchange for a Ukrainian troop) 

 
Not a similar situation, but this sorta rescue (well humanity) reminds me of a ww2 situation I forgot most details, but something about how the Germans were defending a position in a wooded area in some cabin, there was a minefield around close by. Americans attacked Frist before having to retreat when one accidentally ran into the minefield. He was barely alive, screaming and crying I don’t remember his injuries. One German officer watched, waited, and ordered the firing to stop and to allow the American soldiers to come somehow pull their friend away. They never did. So he went over to rescue his enemy instead with a medic team behind him, but unfortunately he stepped on a mine himself and was killed. The Americans still honour him I believe. The German officer didn’t have to do that, he could have shot the American soldier or ignore him, but he didn’t.

Edit: here’s a quote from the grave made for him. “No man hath greater love than who he layeth down his life for his enemy.” His name was Friedrich Lengfeld, he was only 23. The American soldier wounded in the minefield is unknown.",xxhxdp

"This is Great. My only complaint if the behavior of the Ukrainians and their supports come in the form of 1) calling the Russians orcs when they are quite human for better or worse. 2) when they blatantly kill Soldiers that are no longer enemy combatants. The example of this is the video captured by a drone showing it dropping a morter-grenade onto a soldier that was on the ground clearly injured from a explosion and clearly far away from his weapon. It could be argued that it put him out of his missary but I find that they either save him or let him die in the state he was taken out of action. Not after. 

This shows them again in this scenario. And in this case they do not kill him after he is no longer a combatant. I still believe they do not necessarily need to save him but it shows a human element and promptly shuts down the Russian propaganda of Ukrainian lack of humanity. If only the Russians could show any evidence of this same principle.",xxhxdp

"Really nice to see some humanity (pounching wounded was unnecessary tho), after seeing ukranian coock heads, drop bombs on wounded and take gruesome pictures of the dead, this feels a nice change. Although does anyone know if they actually did get him out of the rubble, in the video they say he is stuck and they wont be able to get him out.",xxhxdp
"> the ukrainian soldier fires a round above his head and says we are not like you fuckers

Which is kinda weird after I just watched the clip where an ukranian soldier fires at a closed door assuming a russian soldier might be hiding behind the door, killing the russian without hesitation.",xxhxdp

Rip in peace Viktor Yatsunyk hang in there James keep kicking ass brotha sorry for your lost be safe slava ukraini 🇺🇦 🇺🇸,xxkgzx
Seems like James is coming back to America soon. I have not seen any combat footage from him on his most recent trip. Seems like he is doing a lot of logistics and fundraising currently. Hope he continues to stay safe!,xxkgzx
Is James the guy who was on Speak The Truth?,xxkgzx
I worry for Vasquez and all of the men and women fighting for Ukraine. The trauma they are experiencing. And for Vasquez and others like him to do this as a volunteer doubly so. Putin his cronies and the nation should and will be held accountable. The beacon of freedom is alight because of men and women like this.,xxkgzx
"This dude has gone a little bit crackers - separating from his wife, selling his worldly possessions, throwing himself into combat and the brotherhood in arms, etc. 

It’s noble, sure. More than I’ve ever done. But, you have to kind of wonder if the internet adoration is pushing him along without any brakes applied, and he should maybe be focusing on himself and his mental health a bit more. 

Just my unsolicited 2¢, but it kind of reminds me of the star athlete who puts himself back in the game despite being injured.  Are the fans cheering for short-sighted glory at the player’s expense doing the right thing?  Is the athlete? 

I don’t intend any disrespect by this comment. Just, worry about the guy a little bit.",xxkgzx

Way more upvotes needed here!!!,xxkgzx
"Man this cuts deep, can I contribute to his family? RIP Viktor 🇬🇧🇺🇦",xxkgzx
I hope Vasquez gets x100 killing streak,xxkgzx
This guy seems like a great leader to fight for. Not often that men fight for other countries let alone be there for their children.,xxkgzx
"Victors a real man but this James dude really is a character. Firstly he appears on Speak the Truth. I can't post the link to the video on this subreddit because it won't allow YouTube links so I will post the title of the video for the channel ""Speak the Truth"". The title is ""Why American Volunteers Fighting In Ukraine Don’t Take Prisoners - Part 2"" and it's from June 3, 2022. The time stamp starts at 13:30 where James says he ""had an ACOG on top of an ACOG and a suppressor on the front"". The picture of his rifle is shown on the channel. Firstly it was a commercial Vortex optic with a red-dot Vortex Venom piggybacked. An ACOG and RMR combo costs list price $2200. I paid $2100 for mine. Then his ""suppressor"" is really a four piece AK flash-hider. Now my question is. how does a former US solider get that wrong? That's like calling a M4 Carbine a Remington 700. Also before he did the interview he posted the same picture on Twitter and captioned saying it had an ACOG, no mention of the ""suppressor"" which is really a flash-hider. A few commenters also on his twitter before he made the Speak the Truth appearance also corrected him in the naming of the optic. Then during the interview he went on to say how he used a Javelin to destroy a vehicle. So Rob, the host of the channel asked him, ""hey what did you take out"", James says ""I don't remember."" That right there is a crock of shit. You're going to tell me, you don't remember your very first Javelin kill? A T-72 has a 250"" (inch) barrel and a BMD has a 94"" barrel. Even at distance one can make out the silhouette. There's a video on YouTube of American soldiers training on a simulator and the viewers can see how the objects appear, and they're clear as day. All the other people Rob's interviewed whether it was Dakota, or the last dude who was on forgot his name he's Ukrainian/American, they all told their stories flawlessly. Rob had to hold James' hand through the interview and pry him for questions. So take what you want from my opinion of the dude, but I think he's full of shit. I creep his twitter feed here and there, and he posted a pic of himself giving a little boy $100. He wrote a caption something to the tune of "" giving a lil boy money"". If one feels charitable they should do it because they want to, not to post it all over the internet to receive praise for being charitable. Be humble. Oh here's a video of everybody's hero picking a fight with an African-American man in a NYC subway and getting beat up by him. The man was at least 100 lbs lighter than James. It was funny, because after, James blamed his jacket and backpack getting in the way. The link to the subway beat down is down below.

  
https://www.reddit.com/r/PublicFreakout/comments/vzxr5z/james\_vasquez\_the\_tik\_tok\_mercenary\_in\_ukraine/  
Enjoy lol. Also why's James uniform and face always clean? I've seen thousands of pics of Ukrainian soldiers and they're covered in dirt, mud, oil, grease, but James is always fresh with his hair jelled. He seems to be doing more interviews and running his mouth than actually fighting. What kind of grown man wears s pink dress shirt, shorts and running shoes. He did another interview with Johnny FD on Youtube dressed like that. Like I said running his mouth. I never watched it but read some comments and people were saying he was calling Russian Grad's HIMARS systems, or talking about suff which didn't add up. I dunno. I've wasted enough time listening to this dude.

  
Somebody mentioned he had a bad conduct discharge or a dishonourable discharge on his dd214 for hitting an officer. I don't know if it's true or not but judging by his attitude I wouldn't put it past him. Somebody also wrote something that he wears a patch for a unit that doesn't add up with his age and timeline. Also James apparently said he served in Desert Storm so that's 1991, but that would make him 16. Apparently in that Johnny FD YouTube interview where he wears a pink dress shirt, shorts and running shoes with his hair gelled dressed like a teenager, he lies 15 times in three minutes. I only caught the first few minutes because it was super cringy, I skimmed through it and at 21:40 Johnny asks James what kinds of tanks he sees and he says ""T-34's T-72's"". T-34's were used during WWII. Oryx the site that collects weapon destruction, loss, and capture data lists no T-34's. He calls Russian Grad's, HIMARS. lol.

  
In addition Ripley's Heroes is registered as a LLC not a charity. James has not done one day of fighting since he's been back, just doing interviews and eating g at restaurants in Kyiv or clothes shopping in Poland. I personally think he's scamming good people into donating money for his own gain. The last two paragraphs I wrote I'm not 100% certain about, but he did say he fought in desert storm and with his age now that would've made him 16. Everything else above is true.",xxkgzx

Good job Ukrainian docs.  Even if the russians could have done this for their own guy they likely wouldn't have.,xxblmk
Treating them like fellow human beans instead of statistics. This is why the world is supporting Ukraine and not Russia.,xxblmk
"Good, it's important to treat POW correctly (besides the Geneva convention).",xxblmk
They even gave him the shirt with written “Russian warship go fuck yourself” to wear for the clip ahah,xxblmk
"This is one of the best weapons Ukraine has to fight with, good PR. They have made it clear time and time again that they are the good guys in this fight. When Russian soldiers see and hear about fair treatment at the hands of Ukrainian captors it makes it that much more likely they surrender. It also makes it harder on Putin to lie and claim Russia is the victim. Lastly, it makes it easier for friendly governments to keep supporting Ukraine. In* an ugly war Ukraine still keeps its dignity. Good stuff!",xxblmk
"Wait, I said that arm was fucked. Glad to be proven wrong by talented people.",xxblmk
Why are there so many flys in the room??,xxblmk
"My like is for the excellent work of the Ukrainian doctors and medical team. No matter who the patient is, they always work miracles.",xxblmk

This guy is lucky. It goes without saying but also it would be a good thing to lend as much support to any Russians who want to get out of the bullshit war. Let them go somewhere else in peace.,xxblmk
Also shows just how bad the support structure is in the Russian military.  If you can't even properly treat your own soldiers.,xxblmk
I hope this young man lives a better life now that he isn’t forced to kill,xxblmk

"To be fair the maggots probably helped preventing gangrene, don't they get a thanks?",xxblmk
The maggots probably help out too,xxblmk
Ukrainian people and soldiers have class.,xxblmk
The Ukrainians are showing their true colours. I'd be proud to have them as an ally. I'd want a Ukrainian beside me in battle if it ever came to that. Truly an inspiring people and this is a moment in history that shouldn't be forgotten any time soon.,xxblmk

He’s very lucky that the maggots found his wound could’ve easily died!,xxblmk
"Nice to see how this turned out.  What a change, guy is all cleaned up, clean clothes, in bed, with arm all doctored up, looks like IV in right arm.  Looks like a typical hospital setting.  Looks like the same treatment Ukrainians would give their own.  He is very lucky!",xxblmk
"This dude has a three part series. His surrender, his initial treatment, and the post doctor part.",xxblmk
"Crazy. I would have bet he lost his arm. He still kept it. Good job, Ukrainian meds!",xxblmk
"Maggots in a wound are actually a good thing.... You can get medically cultivated maggots to clean wounds that won't heal on their own. I believe during WWII doctors noticed that soldiers with maggots in their wounds had a better chance of saving the limb than soldiers that did not have maggots.

Edit: I see others have pointed this out already, and more eloquently.",xxblmk

"This is what makes russian soldiers surrender. Keep it up, ukrainians.",xxblmk
"Good to see that the young man is doing better, and I hope that the circumstances will positively contribute to his indoctrinated mindset changing for the better as well.",xxblmk

"That Russian rat went to Ukraine to kill, torture and rape. I would have sewn his arm to his ass",xxblmk
"No need to force him to say ""Slava Ukrainie, heroyom Slava"". For Russians it's like forcing them to say Heil Hit..r.",xxblmk
Put all these Russian mfs to work. Shit ain’t no charity,xxblmk

We need to keep arming them with more advanced weapons. Long range systems, M1 Abram tanks, drones. F35s. By now these could have been trained for, logistically figured out, and in ukranian hands.

How did the soldier know he was in there?,xxcnf7
In some Ukrainian meme channels there is a meme about this video with shrek lying dead in dirt with a caption “guess not sambadi”,xxcnf7
"These guys are not police officers. A lot of people reference what they think police do and apply that to soldiers. They have rules of engagements and they could be in a area where they are in the process of occupying. It depends what their commanders have instructed them to do. 

They may have been subjected to sneak attacks by lone actors etc throughout the day etc. As such, they may have been told to expect people jumping out of closets and trying to attack them etc. 

The soldier appeared to fire into the door prior to it opening but it is hard to tell if the door was about to be opened. Perhaps the soldier heard something or maybe say a barrel of a handgun started to come out of the slightly opened door. 

Who knows with that volley of gun fire. Needless to say, there won't be any forensic investigation into this. This guy clearly didn't have a rifle though. 

Unfortunate if the guy could have had a chance to surrender.",xxcnf7

"I need more context about why this guy was in the toilet without his weapon, hiding

Edit:  I’m not casting dispersions on the Ukrainians for shooting this guy, he was a combatant in front of them, not behind their lines, he was a valid and potentially lethal target.  Just wondering what that guy was thinking that he ended up like that in his last moments, thst could have been me or any of us, just wondering why he made the decision to be in there, hiding",xxcnf7
Do we know what the Russian soldier was yelling while dieing?,xxcnf7

"Would have been a lot easier to surrender instead of run. He really didn’t have a chance to though. I really don’t blame any Ukrainian for not hesitating to shoot first and ask questions later. It’s not police with a search warrant, it’s war. You can’t give the enemy the chance to shoot you first is the main point. At least he didn’t suffer and they followed through humanely.",xxcnf7

"The jokes on here are pathetic. Presumably people struggle to comprehend the brutality of what they just watched, so they make jokes. But you know what? This is a fucking brutal death. No idea if there was some particular context missing here, he seems to be unnamed, hiding, even attempting to run as he is shot. Many terrible things happen in war, many of the combatants even deserve what they get. Imagine raising this man from a young boy, feeding and educating him, and he dies in some toilet in Ukraine. He probably never wanted to be there, probably a conscript. I say this because the comments from other Redditors are as disturbing as this video.

We don't know who he was or why he was there, but this was an ugly, sad end to a human life. It is not entertainment.",xxcnf7

This is judging without context, who knows the guy shot at them before and then ran, maybe the guy committed terrible acts, we don’t know. BUT judging from the context we have I say this is not right.",xxcnf7
Where’s the giving head link?,xxcnf7
"Hehe nice of you to record and post your war crimes. Man, there are savages on both sides of the war and doing this shit will only make it worse for Ukraine no matter how right they are for defending their country against these Nazis. They need to understand that the only reason almost the entire world supports them is because everyone sees this as a just call for help by a nation that's been invaded, there is a moral high ground to stand on, but if they keep doing this, they might just lose the West's support and all will turn to shit for them.

He believed the people who killed him were not people at all.  There are worlds of psychology that could prove how senseless this war is and how no soldier,  regardless of side, should be blamed.

The families of people mobilised for Russia's war with Ukraine will be given a free sheep, in one republic in southern Siberia.
Families of these men, in the Republic of Tuva, will also receive 50kg of flour, two sacks of potatoes and an unspecified amount of cabbage.

The cost of transportation will also be covered by the authorities, the report added.

The Republic of Tuva press service said 91 sheep had already been delivered to the families of mobilised soldiers.
The official website said: ""With the joint efforts of the authorities and active residents, the relatives and friends of the servicemen and they themselves should feel that they will not be left alone with everyday problems.""",xxznyu

"You want no russian prisoners taken because this is how you get no mercy from your opposition.

If this is widespread Ukraine is just going to stop, sit back and just HIMARS them for 2 weeks straight until their front lines look like the surface of the moon.",xxgm3v
I doubt this is a chemical attack. It's not being reported anywhere else.,xxgm3v
"In the video that was deleted from the other sub, the translation they didn't say anything in the video about chemicals at all.

Also, why such a short clip if their intent is to warn people about that sort of attack? It seems like if it happened, and somebody is taking a video, they'd be doing it with more seriousness that just waving the camera past the victim a couple times so fast you can't see anything.",xxgm3v

russia is a cancer that needs to be removed from the world body.,xxgm3v
Fuck russia! Fuck russians,xxgm3v
"It's about time and way overdue, other countries need to step in and physically help Ukraine.",xxgm3v
"After everything that’s happened and all the bullshit russia has done, they need a good reality check and get sent straight back to scum realm they belong in. There’s no hope for them, russia can’t be saved.",xxgm3v
"I honestly don't think even Russia would be so insane as to result to chemical warfare.  I really, seriously am praying and hoping this comes back unconfirmed.  They seem to breathing and speaking just fine which gives me hope the title is incorrect.  That stuff causes serious lung/respiratory damage.",xxgm3v
"Please stop posting this, it's unconfirmed and numerous people have stated it is dubious to be chemical weapons.

Take a step back and look at the whole picture. The chap sitting up clearly has physical damage to his face and his plate carried has also taken a hell of a beating from something. The other chap laying down also clearly has bandaging on his leg. I'm sorry, but this is war and there's all manner of ways to end up like this.

Chemical weapons also don't mysteriously evaporate into thin air once they touch a human, they get onto clothes and everywhere. They spread, and anyone touching them is also going to be effected. If they seriously suspected chemical weapons in this case, they wouldn't:

\- Keep the goddamn contaminated clothes on them

\- Be in such close proximity to them in a confined space

Speculate all you want, but this doesn't look like chemical weapons. Two very unfortunate soldiers, yes.",xxgm3v
They are just fuckers.,xxgm3v

"For some fun reading, take a look at this article about the time the Wagner group was massacred by the US in Syria:

[That Time US Forces Tore Hundreds of Russian Wagner Group Mercenaries to Pieces in Syria](https://www.coffeeordie.com/wagner-group-syria-khasham) (the Battle of Khasham)

> With the expert direction of Air Force combat controllers and others calling in air and indirect-fire support, waves of F-22 fighters, F-15E strike fighters, AH-64 Apache attack helicopters, AC-130 gunships, B-52 bombers, MQ-9 Reaper drones, and heavy Marine artillery relentlessly punished the enemy force.

> “To make it short, we’ve had our fucking asses kicked,” one Wagner Group veteran reportedly says in a recording. “Yeah so, one squadron fucking lost 200 people immediately ... Another one lost 10 people, and I don’t know about the third squadron, but it got torn up pretty badly too ... They tore us to pieces.”",xxmu87
Who got the video of the dead wagner bro mentioned in the article?,xxmu87
These wagner mercs need to be smashed.,xxmu87
Maybe the Wagner Group survives this war.  It is likely that they fight until there are no more of them left.  I honestly can't say for certain.  This has been a brutal war/,xxmu87

Must suck knowing your country doesn't care about you enough to bring your body back for your family. Then on top of that being told you don't get your 3 million ruples because they are a deserter.

Russian's just don't give a crap about any type of life. Let's get this boy up and healthy and have him join up with a infantry unit and get some pay back..,xx753o
"A sick and disheveled bear. Is this a metaphor for Russia? 

I hope *this* bear gets better. I hope Russians get paper cuts on their nutsacks and use lemon juice for antiseptic.",xx753o
So sad 😞,xx753o

Pour animal he Nevers asked for this mess,xx753o
Russians really do enjoy cultivating a reputation of violence and barbarism. It’s going to be hard for the world to forget.,xx753o
Russians don't deserve to have the bear as a symbol anymore.,xx753o
They could enlist him in the Ukrainian army as the polish did back in WW2 with Wojtek.,xx753o
they should feed it a healthy diet of Russian terrorists,xx753o

"I bet he's already called wojtek, and is fully trained on modern artillery.",xx753o
Russia has no vision for the future only a distorted one of the past. What can Putin offer? What is this world order? How does it look like? What can his model offer to Ukraine? Only death. Putin has no ideas just different set pieces. There is no ideology to follow. Ukraine will win as it has a vision for its own future. Russias vision for the world is that all submit to Moscovite rule and become its slaves. A future that will never come to pass and it will be the demise of Russia. Civil War inside Russia is in the cards. State collapse as well. Russia isn't just losing a war here. This is a nation whose institutions are failing. Russia is on its way to end its own existence not that of Ukraine. What a cruel twist of fate. What an irony of history.,xx753o
Humans are the true monsters….😢,xx753o

Certainly not, unkind *sir*.

You gotta finally accept that your beloved regime acts + looks absolutely and completely wacko by ignoring the facts and making up ridiculous lies non stop.

1. Ukraine did not threaten, invade or occupy Russian territory back in 2014 and in 2022. Russia did.
2. The West is not the evil boogieman of Russian people, the wacko Kremlin regime is.

Lock the hundreds of the sociopathic and schizophrenic regime people away that are poisoning your country from within, and maybe the world will consider treating you seriously at some point again.",xxdxnl

And his liver removed  
And his bowls unplugged

What Putin says and what he does are always twisted from each other.  This may be the end that Putin wanted for Russia.  We can argue that from two fronts.  1. Putin's love of shiny objects and all things Western drives some subconscious veneration of the West which makes him unintentionally (intentionally) fail.  2. Putin's love of shiny objects and all things Western (especially Italian designers) caused him to make some alliances way back in time that helped him take control of Russia in order to eventually destroy Russia.  Which might explain why Trump is so slavishly devoted to Putin.  Trump somehow found out that Putin is not an agent of Russia.  Trump would love being in a secret boy's club like that.,xxj89s

For some background: the Ukraine Carpathian Sich brigade captured 5 of these 2S5 Giats and 10 T-80 tanks in their fighting in the reclaiming of Kharkiv territory.  They gave up the 2S5 artillery to units experienced with handling them (the Carps are an infantry unit) but got to keep the tanks - which has made them very happy!,xx7dh3
"live by the fire, die by the fire :)",xx7dh3
"This is such a surreal war where both sides use essentially the same equipment.  

Brits couldn’t just hop into a German panzer and make it useful in the field.  Or Americans capturing an Iraqi T-72 couldn’t add it to their ranks.  If this were Germans, Dutch or American troops they’d be mostly clueless when it came to employing Russian hardware. Ukrainians are just “thank you very much Vlad”",xx7dh3

"There are at least three [undersea cables in that specific area.](https://www.submarinecablemap.com/submarine-cable/globalconnect-2-gc2)

Oil lines are further south in the Danish Strait.

My guess is that they’ve hit their own LNG pipes and diverted our attention to our own oil and LNG infrastructure. Now that we’ve diverted assets to protect them, they might go after power and communications nodes or cables next due to the above as well as hurt us economically and socially without all the mess of another spill. So this is maybe another escalation short of war.",xxcx3q
Would be quite interesting if there is a pipeline detonation in their general vicinity in the coming days!,xxcx3q
Take it out quick,xxcx3q
Rondezvouz for another pipeline sabotage,xxcx3q
Could be an oil-transfer location. A lot of russian oil is getting around international sanctions by getting transferred at sea from russian tankers to tankers from the international merchant fleet. India and other countries are getting a lot of it this way.,xxcx3q

"There was a German submarine passing by through the day... they know...

Think it could be an at sea transfer of oil to try and hide the origin of it and bypass sanctions. I know since the war began the amount russia has been doing this has gone up like 2000%,xxcx3q
If it is a search and rescue ship then maybe they did lose another sub.,xxcx3q
Is there a pipeline near there?,xxcx3q
If they lost another sub then this year is not going to be a good one them.,xxcx3q
"The fibres nearby (west and south east) are quite unimportant. This would not be a severe loss. 
But who knows, what these pricks are up to 🤷‍♂️",xxcx3q

"Article written from middle east perspective, definitely by someone understanding middle east but wrong about Europe.

"The only diplomatic outcome can be Russia exiting all of Ukraine.  

Since Putin won’t, and can’t do that under Russian law; Ukraine is compelled to continue the fight to liberate all its lands.

It is not US hubris or arrogance ignoring their recent past.  It’s international reaction to events happening now.",xxrz7t

"Yup. For the most part, on target or at least a valid middle Easter perspective. 
Except:

“While Ukraine may have turned the tide for now, Russia has more than a few options, including the use of overwhelming airpower and tactical nukes.”

If Russia had overwhelming air power, they would have used it. They only had the image of that sort of capability. Underpowered Ukraine fought them to a standstill. Fully supplied Ukraine has made the sky over Ukraine a very dangerous place for Russian pilots. 

When it comes to tactical nukes, you only have to look at a map to see why they are not that valuable.  Certainly not considering the international backlash. Let’s imagine they had 20 tactical nuke size conventional weapons. What would they shoot to make a real difference?  The map is to big. Forces too spread out.",xxrz7t

"TLDR  He rammed the gates of the Russian Embassy in Dublin in early March 2022 knocking them down and is now in Court charged with malicious damage.   
He did this after seeing footage of a family wiped out in Irpin,",xxbv68
"Doin' God's work, he is.",xxbv68
"A church supplier charged with ramming the Russian embassy gates in Dublin has been sent forward for trial before a Circuit Court judge and jury.
Desmond Wisley (49), was served with a book of evidence at Tallaght District Court today.
Gardaí arrested him on March 7 after his firm's lorry reversed and crashed through the gates of the building at Orwell Road, Rathgar, on the city's south side.
Afterward, he told protesters he saw pictures of a family killed in Irpin, Ukraine, following the Russian invasion.
Clips of the incident were shared widely online and in the media.

The accused of Tully, Ballinamore, Co Leitrim, sells religious products, including wine, bread, altar cloths, banners, candles and vestments.

Gardaí charged the businessman with dangerous driving at the embassy and criminal damage to the gates.
The following day, he was granted €300 bail after agreeing to obey a list of strict conditions sought by Garda Aishling Conroy.
The case resumed before Judge Patricia McNamara at Tallaght District Court today.
The Director of Public Prosecutions (DPP) had indicated that the matter could be disposed of in the District Court if he pleaded guilty.

Otherwise, it would go forward on indictment in a higher court with broader sentencing powers.

Judge McNamara heard he wanted a jury trial.

Today, after the book of evidence was served on Mr Wisley, Judge McNamara acceded to the State's request to make a return for trial order.
She sent him forward to the Dublin Circuit Criminal Court, where he will face his next hearing on November 4.
She remanded Mr Wisley on continuing bail.
However, he must stay away from Orwell Road, Dublin 14, and Ailesbury Road, in Dublin 4; refrain from social media posts about the court case, and not contact any embassy staff. At his first hearing on March 8, Garda Conroy told the court that he ""made no reply to either charge"".",xxbv68

"As a political leader Kadyrov was not a legitimate target for the Ukrainian army.  As a General in the Russian army, he is.",xx3y8d
"This is clearly Putin retaliation after Kadyrov attacks.
Is kinda karma.
You complain? Ok, now you are a fucking general. Go on field and show what you can do. Lol",xx3y8d

one step closer to becoming admiral general supreme leader aladeen.,xx3y8d

Easier to control, pumps his ego, has extra responsibilities that he will have to fulfill (prob conscription numbers) and if he steps out of line, he can be ordered to the front.

"Semi serious question: 

Is Kadyrov Putin's successor?

There doesn't seem to be anyone else who could compete for the position and Kadyrov is his internal enforcer, like Stalin was to Lenin, only much stupider.

Kadyrov becoming tzar would be like Attila becoming emperor of Rome after the empire had already collapsed.",xx3y8d

Trying to appease him as Kadyrov has been very vocal attacking Russian MOD conduct of war. Putin playing balancing act playing competing factions off against one another.   Some pretty serious infighting going on and big risk Putin will loose control and it will get out of hand.,xx3y8d

Hasn’t Putin been sending his army generals to the front?,xx3y8d
"For those unfamiliar with the process:

1) Kadyrov is a very public figure in Russia 

2) Kadyrov faults Russian Army, its generals and basically Putin for war failures

3) Putin anoints Kadyrov Grand Puba of the army  (you are here)

4) Army inevitably suffers more defeats

Now you go to front to make your tik tok videos.,xx3y8d
Very good. Let a Chechnya warlord be in charge of the etnic Russians that fought Chechens. Putin is stable genius.,xx3y8d

"I see a lot of vehicles which have burnt out without any blatantly apparent signs of impact damage.

The BTR-82A, seems like it may have been struck by something near the engine compartment, as the top covers are blown open. Furthermore, there seems to be evidence of bulging in the metal surrounding the engine, so perhaps it was hit by something precise such as an ATGM or a tank shell.

I would expect artillery damage to leave signs of shrapnel (multiple perforations) along the sides of the vehicle.

I'm astounded by the sheer amount of destroyed Russian hardware littering Ukraine. It really does feel like they are eroding away the accumulated Russian hardware which has been sitting around since the cold war.",xx7e5j

just a reminder: RPC (the main provider of the crosses in russia) approves the war and murders of Ukrainians.,xwsn4k
"You know, it is possible to have sympathy for the loss of a young man, and still condemn the invasion and the invading forces that he was part of. 

I wish misery, defeat, and death for every Russian invader as much as the next guy, but you can't act like they aren't human beings like you and me. This kid should have been free to live his life in his own home, and this war should have never happened",xwsn4k

Wait until the conscripts start showing up in numbers.  They body count will grow astronomically.,xwsn4k
Russians need to understand that the only way to end putins regime is to get out and walk to moscow and everyone I mean all Russians to hold him accountable and be removed by the people russian soldiers won't shoot its own when they see them out in the streets protesting and angered.,xwsn4k
You know what's sad? Dead children. Tortured civilians. Tortured POW's. Bombed cities.,xwsn4k
I keep seeing people pointing out how many people left Russia to avoid war. I would like to point out the chaos most of then are causing outside there country. Most of then still support their dictator. They go around rallying the US embassies begging to west to stop supporting Ukraine. They verbally assult Ukraine refugees where ever they can and although they decided not to fight for there country they still spread hate and animosity among the world and expect us to feel bad for them. One feel bad for the innocent this has been going on to long to see any of them as innocent anymore. Ukraine is innocent they are the victim,xwsn4k

Ukraine is better off Ukraine, Russia is better off changing and having radical reform, it's broken rotten to the core system treats its citizens with contempt where life is cheap and in many ways actually ""worthless"" Russian political/culture needs to fail and it needs to change. what it brings to society has no benefit, the system they run punishes the russians and everyone else, to line the pockets of a criminal mob",xwsn4k

"Another child and a lifetime of potential wasted. ""Wasted Talent""",xwsn4k
I hope this photo makes it to all these Russian soldiers and mothers of these Russian soldiers. If anything the Ukrainians can make a huge billboard of this and hang it up some where in Moscow for everyone to see,xwsn4k
One day his mother will see this picture and maybe then she'll understand who Russia's real enemy is....or hopefully was. (And it's not the Ukrainian people),xwsn4k
There is no glory gained in the blood of children.. R.I.P.,xwsn4k
"Yup, just cause he looks like an innocent little kid doesn’t mean he was",xwsn4k
Important to remember that there are human beings and not just savages who have been forced to fight for Putin. A very sad photograph indeed. Looking forward to the video of Putin's execution once the rest of Russia wakes up.,xwsn4k
That was a child. Not even 17. Putin is a filthy pig.,xwsn4k
"let me remind you for a moment, that HE WAS AN INVADER.  
He wasn't killed by ukrainians on russian soil!  
and this is the outcome for people who allow dictators to rule them.  
those killed in ukraine could've fought for their freedom in ruzzia, but they didn't.  
he got what he deserved.",xwsn4k
"P(p)utin hulio! We will bury you at sea!

Sleep now, this hell is over, child. In the afterlife may you give us strength to assure this doesnt happen again. I wish someone would have told you, you didnt need to go to Ukraine, there are no NAZI there, noone hates you, noone wanted to kill you and you are a human being just like me. Its a shame we never break bread we could have told showed you maybe even went fishing at the sea. You still had a future to 'be a man' but Putinism robbed you. This I do not forgive. I'm not sad, because now you are free and no longer a zombie willing to terrorize innocent people. I wish goodnesss and peace is what you sprinkle on the Earth forever, your fight is over. Peace. Now, you have moved on and we no longer are forced to be enemies.",xwsn4k

"Imagine this poor kid's parents. You dedicate 18 years of your life raising a kid, who you love and cherish and who is effectively your whole future, and just like that he's sent to his death in a foreign country by a sadistic despot who only cares for his own fucked up legacy.

If I were this kid's father I'd be out for blood.",xwsn4k
He is in the astral now. Destruct in putler mindless war. Rest now.,xwsn4k
Dont forget that he helped in war crimes and crimes against humanity. He supported ruzzia. The world is better of without him.,xwsn4k
Putin’s stupid pointless war.,xwsn4k
WTF is this title? Did you forget to remove your Russian instructions from a template? What were you supposed to вставить?,xwsn4k
"Whether you're religious or not, there is a lot of poignancy in this photo.

Personally, as an atheist, I interpret his clutching at the cross as a deeply sad symbol of the utter wastefulness and futility of this war. He fought for a futile cause - perhaps willingly, perhaps reluctantly, we cannot know and can only assume that he was young and dumb, as we all are at some point in our lives. I also see the image as a reminder of the blood on the hands of religion. The Russian Orthodox Church plays no small role in stoking nationalism and convincing Russian men that they are doing God's work by going to war. It disgusts me.

I can also appreciate that believers will interpret the image in others ways.

I think we can probably all agree that he should never have been there and this was a waste of a young life, but this is how it must be so long as this fascist invasion continues to murder, rape and torture on Ukrainian soil.",xwsn4k
[removed],xwsn4k
That is a child. **A child**. For fucks sake! **Fuck you Putin!**,xwsn4k
"I see many comments saying how sad, how young and all the rest, lets not forget he is not on his own soil, yes he may be a conscript, but you must of seen the many videos of the new conscripts, they are happy to to be going and killing Ukrainians.

We do not know the story behind this lad, but the truth is if he did not die, there is a good chance he would be involved in the killing of civilians, I bet he would be very happy to be policing Crimea.

If all these conscripts did not want to fight in Ukraine they had the chance to fight back, in Russia for there right to free speech and choice.

They could of run to the borders like many others, yes I know things happen to those who do not turn up for conscription but for those who do this is what happens. They had a choice go kill Ukrainians or refuse and take the consequences they choose what they feel is the easiest kill civilians.",xwsn4k
"So, now i should get ""bad feelings"" for him ? ...

Sorry, but i cant - even if he was forced to join the RU army by mobilisation, he ended up on frontline - fighting.He didnt reject his mobilisation cause of consequences ...I would be sorry or would feel bad for him and his parents, if he would lie dead on Moscows street because he faught for his freedom",xwsn4k
I don’t care that he looks young. I don’t care that he was religious. He didn’t need to be in Ukraine. He could have ran away like the others. I bet this kid would have went home and bragged about all the people he killed. I don’t feel bad when they don’t get that chance.,xwsn4k
"That is the image of this war, should show it on television throughout the world so people realise exactly what's going on",xwsn4k
"at this point I don't even hare about him, his age or that cross",xwsn4k
Kid can’t be any older than 20. Had his whole life ahead of him to have it stolen by Putin. Sad.,xwsn4k
"poor kid, the worst thing is that maybe he thought he was going to heaven when all he did was invading a country for no reason.",xwsn4k
"This kid died for *nothing*.

Ugh. Rip",xwsn4k
"That’s a pretty sad photo, another young life wasted for 1 man and his dreams",xwsn4k
"misleading clickbait title, what if he was killed by friendly fire?

if this picture is in the context of death on the battlefield, this person had 1000 moral choices he made before ending up where he is. surrender is a choice. going to prison but being alive is a choice. awol is a choice. he made a choice to chance it and  kill others or be killed.",xwsn4k
May he be embraced by the lord,xwsn4k
"you feel sympathy for this guy, but you shouldn't. He is a murderer and came to our land voluntarily. He came to kill, rape, steal. His young age cannot be an excuse.",xwsn4k
"Don't feel sorry for him. He could have kept his ass home, surrendered to the nearest Ukrainian patrol, or flee to a neighboring country. He chose to be there and people die in war",xwsn4k
This shit kills me... yes Putin is a piece of dog shit for sending these kids to their grave.  Are their Russians who want to be there to kill and torture Ukrainians... of course! Are their Russians the who don't want to be there and were forced under the idea if they don't they will go to prison or worse...100% I have zero sympathy for any Russian who is actually enjoying killing innocent people... they can rot in hell! But for the kids.. like this guy.. who barely looks 20... who most likely didn't want to be there... my heart goes out to them. War is ugly... I've seen and lived it many times myself! They are still humans.. they still have families.. brothers.. sister's... wives.. even kids... who will never get to see them again because their piece of shit dictator sent them to a war they know they can't win at this point!,xwsn4k
I imagine he had just enough time to find the Cross he wore and to say a prayer that God's mercy rest upon his eternal soul.,xwsn4k
POOtin’s hell is coming to ruZZian now…,xwsn4k
"No good men among the living, no bad men among the dead",xwsn4k

Well that cross aint going to help that pos. Does the mythical all seeing god welcome people who leave their homes to murder others? Nope. Throw that trash in a ditch.,xwsn4k
"Every orc should use the numbers Ukrainians have been blasting in order to surrender. Spare your mothers grief, Ukraine will win!

How many Ukrainian kids died, and some far worse, hard to have pity when no quarter was given.",xwsn4k
"I guess the boy's cross didn't help him, Now he's probably going to be sent to Kyiv in the boxcar fridge, where your sent if the Russian military doesn't want to pick up the dead body until the war is over or get in touch with the family to pick him up.",xwsn4k
Just want to cry,xwsn4k
"I honestly feel bad for him, can’t imagine how lonely and scared his last moments were. The only thing he could do was hold the cross to feel peace.",xwsn4k
I can’t help but wonder if he was terrified before dying. Rest in peace.,xwsn4k
"Fuck man he looks Super Young ,way to young to die. 
Fuck Putin 
RIP",xwsn4k
RIP my man.  May your death bring peace to those grounds.,xwsn4k
Another one bites the dust.,xwsn4k
He came to rape and plunder he had a choice to pay 300usd fine for not going into the military or this. He chose this.,xwsn4k
The alien from outer space has nothing to do with you and your decisions.,xwsn4k
RIP,xwsn4k
"His greatest contribution to the world was to feed maggots, worms, crows, and ants. Sad, here could've composed an opera or painted a mural, but chose to be a murderer for Putin instead.",xwsn4k

Dude looks like Ryan Trahan.,xwsn4k
This hit my heart strings. Putin needs to burn,xwsn4k
One of the more saddest picture.. so young and he had faith in God... yet did he really even know why he was in Ukraine?,xwsn4k
"Putin has to be stopped. These are just children being sent to slaughter.

The youth of today in Russia have to stand up and be counted!",xwsn4k
Ukraine didn't kill him. Putin's vanity did.,xwsn4k
Vale!,xwsn4k
That doesn't look like a natural hand pose. Often people will take someone's cross and have them hold it in their hands.,xwsn4k
Where were those morals when attacking Ukraine?,xwsn4k
photo with impact,xwsn4k
I've seen too many young men whose lives were taken for money and power.,xwsn4k
Still makes me so mad that Putins lies can cause this much suffering. Hope he dies very soon.,xwsn4k
"I hope he found peace and forgiveness, kid is younger than i am ...",xwsn4k
"Jesus, a fuckin kid.  He should’ve been worrying about getting some pussy this Friday, NOT fuckin dying",xwsn4k
looks like sombody put this cross in his hand after he died,xwsn4k
"At the very least died of fright, shot in left cheek exited right, Id imagine choking on his shattered jaw/teeth. 

So unfair so unjust all and every bit of this fricking ""special operation"", I do hope there is a hell because there's going to be a lot of people to greet and welcome you putler 👿",xwsn4k
May they give him a proper burial poor kid,xwsn4k
"What is it about corpses that makes it look so ""fake""?

Does anyone else get the same impression this kind of looks like a cross between a wax figure and a prosthetic plastic doll??

I don't have war experience so I don't understand but why do all these corpses just seem so ""plasticky"" looking and not ""real"" in the sense that it doesn't even look like a human (or at least what a human corpse is ""supposed"" to look like?)  You can compare with living photos of people vs dead but this looks like a botched job of a funeral home's corpse preservation or something.",xwsn4k
Not even that cross could save him from Poo-tina.,xwsn4k
If it werent for that plastic bag it would 100%look like a ww2 pic,xwsn4k
"Another goddamn kid, dying in terror, a thousand kilometers from his loved ones...

Fuck you, Putin.",xwsn4k
That's a good one. One for the history books and the cover of Time.,xwsn4k
"to be honest, he can rot away. if u trully dont want war u throw ur gun away and go into another direction. u might get shot by russian standards but at least u die with a good feeling. now u might have shot innocent people your self or deffended ur russians pal his back while he shot innocent people. i dont really care for this guy. more ukrainians are shot or seen things that they shouldnt have seen and are hurt for the rest of their life while russia has nothing to do in ukraine.   
ofcourse i know a human is a human we are all the same but this person had a choice like i said above.",xwsn4k
I'm taking that cross as a token for my kill,xwsn4k
[removed],xwsn4k
Dude was probably a fuckin rapist.,xwsn4k
Too bad their isn't a god. Maybe it would prevent this sort of shit from happening.,xwsn4k
His cheeks are still flushed like he still has a pulse.,xwsn4k

"Honestly, with medical care he's probably ok. His arm still has good color, and hurts badly. Both are good signs. 

Maggots usually keep the wound from getting badly infected. They're still used today to debride diabetic ulcers when they're trying to save the limb.",xwps0j
Tampon can't fix that.,xwps0j
Maggots are probably helping but that arm is fucked.,xwps0j
1 boot+ 1 flipflop,xwps0j

"Maggots only eat necrotic tissue, which is good, but he's at risk for several kinds of infections from non-medical grade maggots like these. His hand is swollen and pale, but not grey or black, which is also a good sign. And he can still feel local pain, which is also a good sign. With adequate treatment, he shouldn't lost his hand. But he will have a nasty scar.",xwps0j
Literally just finished eating dinner thankfully. Gross,xwps0j
Are the maggots due to the infection or placed there to clean the wound? Just like in Gladiator loool,xwps0j
The maggots to clean the wounds 🤢,xwps0j
I hope the captured soldier will get treated soon and fast 🙏,xwps0j
Might have to lose that arm. Do they have no medicines? Jeebus that was a lot of maggots in a big ass hole. His hand was so swollen i doubt he could move it without intense pain.,xwps0j

This shit makes me so depressed all the POW videos where not only their conditions and how they came to fight in this godforsaken war but because they understand each other perfectly they teach Russian in Ukrainian schools and here they are invading a country that already has enough Russian influence but most of its culture and history was already taken by Russia just really seems like a bull seeing red when anything about Ukraine’s national recognition is being talked about,xwps0j
"I almost feel sorry for the guy. Probably there were no medics around, and no one gave a shit if there were. And now he'll lose an arm for Putin.",xwps0j
The guy almost passed out.  I think I would also if I saw my arm like that!,xwps0j
"correct me if i'm wrong, but maggots are generally a good thing. they eat dead tissue, so they're good for keeping a wound clean and preventing further decay. they're literal babies too which means there's no risk of them laying eggs. might be keeping this guy healthy until he can see those professionals",xwps0j
"A nice reminder to keep your elbows tucked when peeking around a corner during combat, idk what happened to this guy but I used to get shot in that spot all the time when I peeked in paintball",xwps0j
There is no excuse for that on a modern battlefield unless you were stranded out somewhere for days alone. The only guys Russia's good at killing are their own.,xwps0j
Maggots on a maggot! Huh. Interesting,xwps0j
Can we uh …. Maybe a little saline flush or somethin?,xwps0j
Those maggots probably saved his life. Very likely at least saved the arm.,xwps0j
At least he can still wank it! If that was my right arm I would be blue balling it,xwps0j

"Glad to see more NATO training is making it through. You’ll probably see my comment I made under a guy. 

I’m not sure about all of NATO, but I know it’s US Army conventional SOP to operate at night. We’ve mastered it because the insurgent Militias did not have night vision capability. So moving and raiding at night was such an extreme advantage. Literally from the first phase of BCT at benning at least, we were doing night walks with NVGs. Nauseating. These guys have high speed binocs, but it makes depth perception kinda ass. Foreground guy seems to have a peq, which is the call of duty IR laser when NVGs are active. Makes it so to aim, they just have to put the laser on the target and shoot, because ofc you aren’t going to put your sight to your googles, or take them off to shoot. 

If they start equipping all their guys with NVGs, the lower speed monocular ones, the more affordable more conventional friendly ones. They will be crazy.

PS: when moving with the monocular NVGs, you have to keep both eyes open for depth perception. So one eye sees clearly and the other one sees darkness. So hard. 

PSS: Maybe only scouts had this training, but I’m sure infantry guys did too. I’m sure all US combat arms trained on NVGs",xwvnqd

"I love how they raised the main gun of the BMP and tied a white flag to it.

How much will the Russian soldiers get for surrendering with The armour carrier?,xwgaby
Ukrainians are so bad ass.,xwgaby
"Wow, amazing footage",xwgaby
Nice of the Russians to be resupplying the Ukrainian army.,xwgaby
I wonder how many times this has happened in the last few weeks?,xwgaby
"I am sure 💩tler loves the little improvised white flag (is it a footcloth? 🤣) on top of a Russian tank with his rats 🐀 scurrying out. 
   Is it just me or do the Russians look like they’ve stumbled out of a World War II movie and the Ukrainians look like bada$ses",xwgaby
"With their white flag, they must have been driving around looking for someone to surrender to.",xwgaby
"I’m glad this worked out for everyone, Russians and Ukrainians alike. The Russians here did the right thing and I’m glad they’re alive and not murdering civilians. 

I think we forget sometimes that there are human beings on the Russian side. This war has made me bitter, and angry. Pushing me towards hating Russians, ALL of them. 

But that’s not necessarily fair. Some of these Russians have been lied to, and misled. Pressed into service under abysmal conditions, given little to no equipment. 

This is just a net positive outcome. Maybe those Russians can go home to their families in peace.

But those involved in torture, murder and indescribable suffering inflicted on Ukraine…. Lock them up and don’t let them see the sun ever again.",xwgaby
Are these flipping SAS? Nice.,xwgaby
Looks like surrender? White flag on the gun!? 🤔,xwgaby
same language's kills each one themselvies,xwgaby
"This is the best russians can do, also get paid for the BPM (allegedly).",xwgaby
Sure if you gonna surrender why not make some extra money :D,xwgaby
There is nothing sexy about war but i can't deny that seeing a team of people acting in unison to achieve the humane capture of enemy combatants in an active warzone.... Yea that orchestra or engrained dance of a team to achieve a goal was fun to watch.,xwgaby
Looks how well equipped AFU troops are nowadays. It’s seriously impressive.,xwgaby
"Is there a policy the Ukrainian army has in case it suspects surrendering Russian soldiers. Like for example when they see a Russian soldier with a white flag or distributing leaflets indicating how the surrendering soldiers should present himself, like tear part of their uniform or something like that. Since so many Russian soldiers don’t want this war most likely they can just surrender to an Ukrainian soldier and apply for asylum or be given the option to fight on belhalf of Ukraine.",xwgaby
Ran out of gas or what or did it just break down,xwgaby
The Russians look bad how can they hold on fighting like this,xwgaby
Long version of this is even more interesting as you can see the Ukrainians waiting for Russians on the side of embankment and the APC coming toward them flying white flag.  Tensions as it comes up to them and then turns parallel going a short distance further.,xwgaby
"The Ukrainians have done this before and they will likely do it again. 

Slava Ukraini!",xwgaby
There's some smart Russians. Get paid to live.,xwgaby
Damn the Ukrainians have some nice hardware Acog’s you name it. Hopefully this war ends soon.,xwgaby
RI's would have probably given this a 'go' in ranger school. These guys are doing a good fucking job.,xwgaby
"I have no idea how to speak any Slavic language.. But I'm pretty sure that the guy shouting at the tank for people to get out is trolling the fuck out of them by calling them the Russian equivalent of John Smith, right?

Does he shout *""MIKHAIL! NIKOLAI!""* and then tell them to get out, lol?

Someone who speaks Russian/Ukrainian, please confirm this champagne comedy for me.",xwgaby
Oh yeah tie me up harder daddy,xwgaby
"I think they defected, with the white flag off the front of the gun",xwgaby
Notice the white flag on the barrel. Russians were intentionally surrendering,xwgaby
"These Russian were not captured, they surrendered, the full video shows them come out of the woods and over the brow with white flags hanging every where,Ukrainian forces were waiting at an arranged point for them.I have uploaded the full video 

Full Video [https://www.reddit.com/r/RussiaUkraineWar2022/comments/xx6fzd/we\_buy\_the\_russian\_army\_russia\_sold\_a\_bmp2\_with/](https://www.reddit.com/r/RussiaUkraineWar2022/comments/xx6fzd/we_buy_the_russian_army_russia_sold_a_bmp2_with/)",xwgaby
more white flags on the guns of russian vehicles would save more russian lives. These russians were smart to surrender.,xwgaby
Can we see a clip of the cash being handed over?,xwgaby
The Ukranians totally forget about the surroundings.,xwgaby
These people migjt have killed hundred of civilians. Just shoot them and let the pigs eat them.,xwgaby
This has to be staged.,xwgaby

"At this point, the front is coming to it.",xwq3ef
"Only as good as the crew and combined arms support. If it doesn't have good of either, it'll end up captured or destroyed, just like any other tank.",xwq3ef
"The good news is, its easily trackable by the enormous smoke cloud it leaves in its wake.",xwq3ef
"I hope we do, so it gets blown up to pieces. They have what, 10 of them?",xwq3ef
"I don't know, the Ukrainians have been doing pretty well without it",xwq3ef
"lmao, some part in the drive train isn't having a good time in that tank.",xwq3ef
My bet: they will use it to make propaganda videos for domestic consumption.,xwq3ef
"Horrible suspension: the thing is bouncing and digging into the ground while struggling to advance at low speed on a mostly flat and dry terrain. Piece of shit.

They won't use it in Ukraine because they will lose buyers when those buyers see it perform poorly. -And also because they only have a handful of them.",xwq3ef
"This tank is good for Instagram and Tiktok. 

It won't last 60 seconds in a hot AO.",xwq3ef
It’s engine sounds like it’s screaming for help,xwq3ef
"I bet the Ukrainian Tractor Guy is rubbing his hands in anticipation.

I wonder what the bounty for this model would be.",xwq3ef
That’s tractor bait right there.,xwq3ef
The lack of a stabilized main gun on all these tanks blows my mind,xwq3ef
It's like giving an airplane to a monkey,xwq3ef
"I hope the crew took their seasick pills that thing rocks back and forth worse than a boat in a storm.

It sounds like it's falling apart already too.",xwq3ef
Wheres the barrel stabilization? Lol,xwq3ef
Sounds like it's driving with the parking brake on! ![gif](emote|free_emotes_pack|feels_good_man)![gif](emote|free_emotes_pack|poop),xwq3ef
It smokes a lot. I can't tell if that was a shitty smokescreen or a dying engine.,xwq3ef
Soon to be blessed by Saint Javelin 🙏,xwq3ef
We'll see it burning at the front.,xwq3ef
Is it supposed to sound like a clogged vacuum? 🤔,xwq3ef
"Russian people must be asking... ""where are our Wunderwaffe/wonder weapons. They been seeing them in parades for years but they are MIA on the battle field.",xwq3ef
Isn't this the tank that has a toilet inside? Must be a blast sitting next to Ivan straining and grunting while the tank slowly fills with the smell of shit.,xwq3ef
Soon it will belong to Ukraine people LOL.,xwq3ef
Seems quite smokey for brand new tank?,xwq3ef
"This doesn't look Euro 6 compliant, go home tank.",xwq3ef
A shiny looking tank with not a single scratch on it...,xwq3ef
"No chance, will be terrible for sales to see them get blown apart in Ukraine.",xwq3ef
Looks like trash just like the rest of their military.,xwq3ef
Uuh shiny.. wouldn't it be a shame if....,xwq3ef
You drop a 155 Excalibur on top that bitch she go boom,xwq3ef
"Took it out for a spin only to put it back in storage, just like their SU57, they can’t afford to lose these as they can barely afford to produce them",xwq3ef
Where's the main gun stabilization?,xwq3ef
It is an extreme risk. If it takes a round from any of the anti-armor munitions in theater it will die and the propaganda fallout will hurt them a lot.,xwq3ef
Already burning oil... That POS is dead soon.,xwq3ef
It is t-55 with cardboard cover,xwq3ef
Why???,xwq3ef
"UAF must be so scared of those unproven, terribly expensive tanks. It's a shame there are so few of them but so many Javelins, NLAWs, AT-4s and so on.",xwq3ef
I can smell the shit coming out of its engine,xwq3ef
"T72 with plywood panels glued on with no nails adhesive  ""you can do it if you B&Q it ! """,xwq3ef
"I want to see Putler driving it at the front, so we can blow his ass away",xwq3ef
"For a brand new state of the art tank, it's blowing an awful lot of fumes.",xwq3ef
The main gun doesn’t seem to be stabilized. So how’s this a modern tank? It’s more like a T72 with a new turret.,xwq3ef
*tractor heavy breathing*,xwq3ef
*Happy javelin noises*,xwq3ef
I was half-expecting to see this get taken out by a drone or artillery fire at some point.,xwq3ef
Looks like it's going to breakdown at any second.,xwq3ef
Oh god please yes. If only for tankies to shut up about Russian wunderwaffen.,xwq3ef
They need these at the front. It's one of Russia's only tanks that can reverse fast enough to keep up with their strategic retreats.,xwq3ef
"Food for Javelins and M777. If UAF are able to capture them, an even bigger win.",xwq3ef
"Still not Javelin proof, probably. Russians are slow learners.",xwq3ef
That’s it! That’s what is going to shift the tide to ruzzas favor. Putin you genius!!,xwq3ef
"A-10 says ""Bbbbbrrrrrrtttttttt""",xwq3ef
"Naw, they barely have enough to show off on parades in Moscow/St Petersburg.",xwq3ef
Honestly I'm surprised the 10 they have haven't shown up already,xwq3ef
"Engine generates own smokescreen, no additional accessories necessary",xwq3ef
"No reactive armor or even, it appears, anywhere to put the blocks? Am I missing something? (Other than that T-14 is smoke and mirrors, and mostly smoke at that...)",xwq3ef
Looks like a tank proving ground.,xwq3ef
Bloody smokey engine.,xwq3ef
Looks like a Wish.com Abrams.,xwq3ef
We are seeing the history of Russian tanks in this war. We saw a T34 used (I know it wasn’t running but they used it) All the way to maybe t14,xwq3ef
Congrats. They finally have a tank comparable to the tank we started building in the 80s. But they can’t afford to build theirs in masse.,xwq3ef
I'm sure the US would love to get their hands on one of those. Just imagine disassembling every inch and finding all of the weaknesses.,xwq3ef
Given the most common losses of armor are mobility kills and artillery I don't see even a dozen of them making an iota of difference.,xwq3ef
I wonder how long it will be before Ukraine captures this,xwq3ef
"Don't worry, the Armata project is closed.",xwq3ef
They have 14 supposedly operational...,xwq3ef
"So is it just the one then, or.....",xwq3ef
Never. It doesn’t really work.,xwq3ef
"""Welcome to Ukraine""-song bulking up",xwq3ef
"If it hasn't shown up yet, it won't.",xwq3ef
From what I’ve read they don’t have production models so this might end up there but not in numbers. Knowing Russia this is probably a 1984 Lada with really well done construction paper hull. It looked at from behind you can actually see that they only use the Lada as a shell and that locomotion is provided by 15 Russian acrobats all riding one bicycle. Honestly that’s pretty complex even if they’re not using top end tech.,xwq3ef
Where is the cope cage? If that is headed to the front in a few days I’m going to see a rusted out hulk with scorched orcs pretty close to that pile of crap.,xwq3ef
It screams so loud that Macaulay Culkin should avoid Ukraine to avoid getting HIMARed.,xwq3ef
Can it dodge Javelins?,xwq3ef
"Cool, the Russians delivered a new tank to Ukraine 🇺🇦 Slava Ukraini!!",xwq3ef
Good drone targeting practice i say,xwq3ef
nope it won't go to the front since they cannot afford to loose any of them since nobody wants to buy it. hence it is expensive as Fuck,xwq3ef
T14 for target nr14,xwq3ef
Need capture 1 asap🇺🇦,xwq3ef
"A tank does not an army make. 
Slava Ukraini 🙏🇺🇦",xwq3ef
How many of these tanks have been seen together at the same time?,xwq3ef
"I think it would be an amazing tank, if they could afford enough to use them large scale",xwq3ef
They will find it abandoned due technical or electrical issues.,xwq3ef
"Nope. This tank is only for parades, and even then, it can't do the job.",xwq3ef
Piece of junk...  tanks are a liability now..,xwq3ef
Reminds me of the Tiger 11 the Germans introduced at the end of World War II. Too little too late.,xwq3ef
"People aren't even scared of nukes anymore. Not like we used to be. So what difference would the two and a half Armata do at the front?

I wish this was true. Because the tanks from the Russian mostly die because of stupid strategies. And this one go to its fate.

Imagine the kick in the stomach for all those brainwashed russians when they see their Wunderwaffe go up in smoke. Or even better: Being towed off by a tractor 😂",xwq3ef
It will show up with the robo dogs…😂😂,xwq3ef
The farmers are waiting to collect these shitboxes.,xwq3ef
This looks like a tank/military training ground. Probably not in Ukraine.,xwq3ef
So no barrel stabilization on a T-14?,xwq3ef
"Corruption and lies have reach such a level now in Russia that you can see they even can't take proper care of simple soldiers. A tank is much more complex logistically wise. 

Not mentioning here that the armata is probably another lie ""fake it until you make it"".",xwq3ef
"At least they'll be able to spot it, with the amount of exhaust fumes.",xwq3ef
The tracktors are waiting,xwq3ef
"Just another thing to destroy. An armoured crew capsule won't help when a track's destroyed, their engine hit or especially their remote controlled turrets or cameras knocked out.  
  
If the Ukrainians capture one like they did the T-90, it's game over for Russia on the armoured front. All these high-tech features for nothing.",xwq3ef
"It will be a huge blow to the usual Russian narrative ""Russia is only using old equipment""",xwq3ef
Javelin missiles is waiting for it,xwq3ef
Javelin fodder.,xwq3ef
"Yes, all working.... i mean all three of them",xwq3ef
A javelin will sort it out,xwq3ef
Send it!!!,xwq3ef
"Unlikely. The T-14 is still only a prototype. And one that’s still riddled with technical glitches and cost overruns. If they are deployed, it won’t be in any meaningful number.",xwq3ef
"Just another future pile of junk.

Or maybe it will be surrendered to UF.",xwq3ef
"Is the whistle mounted there, to scare everyone or to give away its distance from Javellin, sou Ukrs dont have to meassurre it?",xwq3ef
"another Russian ""magic mushroom"" that's actually just a highly polished turd.",xwq3ef
"It is a ruzzian POS, like the rest of what they put into the field.",xwq3ef
Javelin magnetic deployed,xwq3ef
"The gun is not stabilized? 
German Leopard tanks had stabilized guns back in the 80s.",xwq3ef
"I hope so, so we can see this POS blown to bits.",xwq3ef
Engine sounds like it is screaming in fear or pain.,xwq3ef
"Ever seen more than one?

Sure there is more than one?",xwq3ef
Western Intelligence would love one!,xwq3ef
It’s pointless because they won’t use it likes it’s meant to be. It’s won’t last in the filed.,xwq3ef
For a new ‘advanced’ tank it’s blowing / burning a lot of oil ! May be it’s coal fired?,xwq3ef
Ukrainian tractors already waits for them.,xwq3ef
someone with a big brain pls geolocate this,xwq3ef
Made of plastic for propaganda purpose. Putin has copied hitlers superwapons that didn’t exist in 1945.,xwq3ef
"This smacks of desperately grabbing a few pre-production prototypes that were still under development and pressing them into service (or at least on TV) before they're really ready.

A very very uninformed guess I'd wonder if any of the systems would really work properly in those or if they've just been nailed together quickly so they'll run & drive for the cameras and maybe shoot if you're lucky.",xwq3ef
"Not real ones, but you might see decoys to try and get UA to waste extra missiles on it.",xwq3ef
What was the name of that other guy who was obsessed with tank super weapons turning the tide in a war in Eastern Europe?,xwq3ef
A new tank for Ukraine's collection.  The crew might have called the surrender hotline already.,xwq3ef
"Look closely at the barrel, notice it’s not stabilized. An abrams or similar modern tank has a stabilized barrel that maintains point of aim as the tank moves and goes over bumps/rough terrain.",xwq3ef
They’ll make great monuments. Not many monuments can move on their own power you know.,xwq3ef
Holy shit it's real? Nah probably CGI Lmao,xwq3ef
What is the screaming noise? Terrible crosscut gearbox design?,xwq3ef
I would love to see how high it's turret launches!,xwq3ef
"Let’s hypothetically assume this is an awesome wonder weapon, better than any tank ever.

There are not enough to make a difference.

Hitler had an obsession with wonder weapons as well. And rather than making 100 cheap weapon systems, they would make these absurd tanks or artillery pieces (Maus, Dora and Gustav) which simply weren’t worth the massive resources and soldiers it took to operate.

Now this is different, this is a normal tank that’s probably good (I’m assuming it’s awesome again, for this thought experiment), but a handful won’t shift things.

And If the Ukrainians are actually worried about it, it will become a giant magnet for ordnance in the battlefield. So I predict this won’t make much of an operational difference, if any.",xwq3ef
Can't wait to watch it explode.,xwq3ef
"Couple of demo tanks ,no production to speak of. Publicity stunt for Putin.",xwq3ef
More food for the javelin.,xwq3ef
"Turret will fly even higher???
🤔",xwq3ef
I hope to see the YouTube review of the Ukrainian army testing it out!!!,xwq3ef
This is a great tank but it can also be Destroyed,xwq3ef
German had the tiger tank. But they didn’t have many. And it didn’t change the war,xwq3ef
it will look beautiful when the Ukrainian flag is waving high over it,xwq3ef
Zero chance we see this on the battlefield in Ukraine. Just my opinion.,xwq3ef
Looks like something made out of cardboard lol,xwq3ef
"Uh, new loot :)",xwq3ef
Probably it’s an embarrassment that’s why it’s not in active service lol 😂,xwq3ef
"Its way of movement doesn't indicate huge treat. The main gun doesn't level, and moves like a turtle. A big smoking turtle running on coal.",xwq3ef
Armour is 99% Hopium and 1% Copium,xwq3ef
Without a working Trophy like system it’s just scrap like any other thing.,xwq3ef
What the hell is that POS 😂,xwq3ef
I hope Ukrainian army guys knows how to drive and handle them new tanks 😂,xwq3ef
Time to see how far their turrets can fly!,xwq3ef
"They're not going to sneak up on the enemy with it, what a fkn noise.",xwq3ef
"There is a lot of video of troop battles, drone footage and Javelin kills but where is the video of armored vehicle battles?",xwq3ef
Unleash the tractor squad.,xwq3ef
"Sure, send it to the front, Ukraine needs more tanks. It’s not like it’ll do much else…",xwq3ef
"Here we see the T-14 in captivity. Away form its natural predator, the Ukrainian Tractor.",xwq3ef
Lol the armata is about as real as a diesel VW Polo with some steel strapped to its sides to make it look like a abrams,xwq3ef
"So where are all the super duper Terminators that gonna turn the tide of war ?

Did they meet an Excalibur round ?",xwq3ef
To paraphrase Jabba The Hutt: “Wee now kong Javelina poodoo” - *”Now you’re Javelin fodder”*,xwq3ef
I read/heard somewhere that there is something like barely a dozen T-14s in existence. They can barely make them because they need the advanced electronics and since 2014 and Crimea they already had sanctions and problems procuring material.,xwq3ef
Well we might see pieces of it.,xwq3ef
That gear box sounds a bit iffy… 😏,xwq3ef
Hoping to see it without the turret in the next 2 months.,xwq3ef
"You're asking the wrong people, you should ask Ukrainian farmers.",xwq3ef
That pos can’t even complete a parade in moscow lol,xwq3ef
A better question is when we’ll we see the front blown off.,xwq3ef
"Two ways this could go:

A. They try to disable it with a Javelin for intel/propaganda purposes.

B. It never makes it off the train because locomotive took a HIMARs rocket to the dome. 

C. A $400 drone drops a grenade in the open hatch",xwq3ef
I wonder high its turret will fly?,xwq3ef
"With the T-14  being sighted in videos...  we have discovered it's weakness... 
simply a lead-paint balloon from above should be able to block it's FCS sensors and radar. leaving it vulnerable to anti-tank weapons.

drone +  lead-paint balloons vs T-14

Spread the word!",xwq3ef
"where's the tractor, hows it going to get back,  ohhhh one way trip",xwq3ef
its needs a companion tractor,xwq3ef
It's not a tank. It's a tractor in a painted plywood frame.,xwq3ef
I think it will end up on fire and stuff like the rest,xwq3ef
"So, no gyro stabilized main gun? What an absolute joke!",xwq3ef
"I give it a week after it shows up at the front, before it's on a plane to the US",xwq3ef

Few will be fit enough to do anything in a months time!",xwi6vy
"I'm trying to watch these video's with a rational eye.

But the scenes coming from the mobilization efforts are almost surreally pathetic.

I see mostly rag tag bunches of rather unfit, poorly equiped middle-aged men, all too often drunk.

I can hardly believe it sometimes.

Just imagine the opposite, NATO soldiers going to battle in a state like this.

What a demasqué this has become for Russia.

And how embarassing.",xwi6vy

Make no mistake, these scumbags want to see Ukraine and its people fall.",xwi6vy
"🇬🇧 If before that we only saw videos from the military enlistment offices and transit points where the teams assembled by the military commissariats are sent, now a new wave has begun. More and more videos appear with abandoned and useless mobilized. The chain of command has been lost, people have weapons in their hands that are not even listed as theirs. They are burning with desire, they want to defend their homeland, but they do not understand what is happening. Once again, we repeat that this is a consequence of systemic problems in the Ministry of Defense and the general unpreparedness of the military colossus for such procedures. And now Russia is going exactly the same way as Ukraine, where the mobilization mechanism began to be perfected in 2014.",xwi6vy
I wouldn’t hire these dodgy looking fuckers to mow my lawn and the Kremlin expects to hold Ukrainian territory with this scum?  Garbage,xwi6vy
I suspect this is just an attempt of ethinic cleansing in Russia,xwi6vy

"Burning with desire to burn in Putins People furnace? The fascist malady has only one cure: Utter and final defeat in battle, laying Russias economy in ruins and making their populace see what they did to the world.

Option B: An iron clad curtain no way in, no way out guarded by barbed wire and NATO soldiers from Finnland down to the black sea. 

Russians and their rotten empire will fall.

"LOL.  The smart ones aren't even worried about surviving the war.

They're worried about surviving the mobilization, lol.",xwi6vy
"I ALMOST feel sorry for them ... but not really because STILL they are conducting Putin's illegal war. Most I can sympathize is: If they get killed, may their deaths be swift & painless. 🤨",xwi6vy

Bunch of unfit men versus Himars with canister shot.  My money is on Himars.,xwi6vy
They have live rounds?  At the mobilization site?  Holy shit.  I don’t know where to start.,xwi6vy
"they are saying they all have weapons but they are not ""assigned"". looks like there's no traceability and soon local organized crime will have incoming inventory..",xwi6vy
I'd feel more sorry for them if I didn't know they'd be raping innocent Ukrainians and each other soon.,xwi6vy

Or even after withdrawal from Kyiv, it was regularly attacked by guided missiles. Now even attacks on Odesa are scarce (recent attacks are made with iranian kamikaze drones). Attacks into deep Ukraine go only as far as Kharkiv, Zaporizhzhia and Mykolaiv. Maybe Dniepro, Kyiv and Odesa.  Western Ukraine is practically not harrassed anymore.

"Пздеть— не мешки ворочать. Где вы были 20 лет, когда в приграничных с Украиной областях не было( и сейчас нет) ни одной украинской школы, где кто хочет— изучал бы язык и культуру? Да даже, в программе ОГЭ и ЕГЭ нет украинского языка, как иностранный, хотя бы могли сделать это для приграничных областей. Так ещё теперь нельзя петь на украинском публично, совсем там епнулись? Подлы, искалечили и угробили сотни и миллионы жизней и судеб людей и все эти годы натравливали людей друг против друга, брата против брат и сейчас это сделали в наивысшей форме. А сейчас значит ""мы уважаем культуру и язык""? Где это уважение, даже к собственному народу? После 2014 и 24 февраля это все уничтожено в буквальном и переносном смысле. Абсолютно все. Вы уничтожили это нашими руками и якобы от нашего лица. Боже, сколько горя и боли вы сотворили... И вам не смыть никогда эту кровь на ваших руках.

Pzdet - do not roll bags. Where were you for 20 years, when there was not (and still is not) a single Ukrainian school in the regions bordering Ukraine, where anyone would like to study language and culture? Yes, even, in the program of the OSE and the Unified State Examination there is no Ukrainian language as a foreign language, at least they could do it for the border regions. So even now you can’t sing in Ukrainian in public, have you fcked right there? Fcks, crippled and ruined hundreds and millions of lives and destinies of people, and all these years they set people against each other, brother against brother, and now they have done it in the highest form. And now it means ""we respect culture and language""? Where is this respect, even for one's own people? After 2014 and February 24, everything is destroyed in the literal and figurative sense. Everything. You destroyed it with our hands and supposedly on our behalf. God, how much grief and pain you have created... And you will never wash off this blood on your hands.

Forgive me for writing such nonsense( just this message is addressed to people from Moscow), it was written through despair and pain. Recalling 2013, when Ukrainians, my good neighbors and loved ones, came to my border region with Ukraine, and how we celebrated holidays together and came to visit each other and talked maybe in different languages, but we understood each other intuitively.

"Ok so now Vladolf can’t hide that his special military operation is a war, and one he is losing. Well, since we can’t call it a war, here are a few other options:

Clusterfuck, dumpster fire, dogs breakfast, snafu, fiasco, debacle, pooch screw, shit the bed, soup sandwich, hot mess, shambles, trouncing, rout, disaster, defeat, collapse, capitulation, catastrophe, lay-down-misere, or simply a shit show.

So any of these options will suffice for those who “can’t mention the war”.

However, I feel that “special military operation” will anyway soon take its rightful place in the above list of synonyms for catastrophic failure in the common vernacular.",xwlbjp
I think this is the beginning stages of a de escalation,xwlbjp
The words of an ill man,xwlbjp
Such irony,xwlbjp
Respect comes from Ukraine HIMARs obliterating the Russian army,xwlbjp
What is he doing?? Doodling?,xwlbjp
Is he playing for the chance of a negotiated cease fire?  Or is he playing for possible war crime trials at The Hague?,xwlbjp
Why so nervous? Just stop jerk off that pen and talk to the camera like you always do,xwlbjp
"Pfft, what a dick.",xwlbjp
MF' s cheese slid off his cracker a long time ago now  the whole world has to deal with it. Selfish fucking asshole.,xwlbjp

"That subtitles are done by a meme maker, right. For the lols",xwlbjp
"This feels like a dream, a world where a Putin actually meant this.",xwlbjp
"""enormous respect"" for Ukraine as well as its culture and language

thats what the Soviets said about all the ethnicities they had occupied  - enormous respect.

once you take over a hostile territory you have to soften it a bit and show that you are friendly, otherwise cant control it for long",xwlbjp
I acknowledge that there are Russians living generational in Ukraine and can and should have a say in their future.  That said those folks need to accept that they are immigrants and if they love life in Ukraine they need to accept that they are Ukrainians,xwlbjp
"Look, he doodles as he talks... that has to mean something",xwlbjp
"Dear Vladimir, we are a little tired of you that make fun of other countries. Do you think you're smart? You're just a little arrogant man that think you are smarter than everyone while others pity you for your misery",xwlbjp

"He says all this while his military, under his orders are bombings, murdering and raping women and children.",xwlbjp
"I guess he does have short memory, but on Feb 22nd 2022 he stated ""Ukraine doesn't exist anymore, just like form USSR countries"". 
State Media pundents, there is no Ukraine and no Ukraine language just Nazis. I'm occupied areas schools are told to teach in Russian language and textbooks in Russian language too, all street signs are all in Russian and schools are also only teaching Russian history no Ukraine History. So I call BULLSHIT on Putin.",xwlbjp
Is that the same guy that assured us all that he wouldn't invade Ukraine few days before he did?,xwlbjp
Didn’t know killing Ukrainians and taking their land means respect.,xwlbjp
"Explain this then and 999,999 other examples of  hatred he has caused in russians towards Ukr :

and i am sure that puddin is a bit pissed off that his idea of recapturing the glory days of  ukrainian aircraft design and building has been set off track a bit.  


the guy is addled and everyone in his circle are so fkn scared of him ....",xwlbjp

What drugs is dude on,xwlbjp

He respects Ukraine so much that he wants to make them part of russia!,xwlbjp

When he smiles I see Ukrainian shoe leather from getting a Ukrainian boot up his arse,xwlbjp

Fuck Putin,xwlbjp
What's he doodling? Playing Hangman?,xwlbjp
Is this real? What the Dutch,xwlbjp
"""We won't discriminate"" sounds more like he is saying ""We will not recognize you as Ukrainian - you are now Russian"".",xwlbjp
Who’s a naughty boy then?. Seriously this contrition is on par with a boy breaking a window with a ball. Yeah Vlad it’s a little bit more serious than that.,xwlbjp
We need to supply the long range himars ammunition to destroy the Russian fleet,xwlbjp
"Bro, if that’s how you treat the cultures you respect you are even **more** fucked up than anybody thinks",xwlbjp
When you brake and beat a bully after that he will always start to respect you and say hi to you. This is just how it goes in life.,xwlbjp
He will soon learn that Crimea is Ukraine fuck putin and fuck its underdogs hope russia soon realizes they have to dump their current government in order to survive as a country.,xwlbjp
Words are cheap. He only says that so he can use that later.,xwlbjp
"And you show it by murdering and attacking them!!

As our artillery shells land on schools and hospitals we remind ourselves that we are showing the greatest love for our Ukraine neighbors but cleansing them of their lives and property.,xwlbjp
"There are no stairs nor windows in the Kremlin?
🤔",xwlbjp
Backpaddle asshole,xwlbjp
He should hire the ukrainian armed forces to protect his country,xwlbjp
He should have said that before he killed a couple hundred thousand Ukrainians.,xwlbjp
Why is he doodling,xwlbjp
Lie and only lie from zputler,xwlbjp
"This fool, fake, shriveled scrotum sack pooptin makes no sense, because he has no sense; can’t wait to celebrate the day he collapses. Wow, just wow, quite the loser flip flopping all over the place. His word is meaningless, his words are meaningless, as is the weight of any comment or thoughts he has.",xwlbjp
Sick people,xwlbjp
This is not a perhaps i treated you too harshly moment,xwlbjp
So are you taking back your statement that they're all Nazis?,xwlbjp
Who here thinks Biden should arm Ukraine with short range artillery tactical nukes? I think this would certainly counter Putin's thinking of using them...,xwlbjp
"Holy fuck, his grip on reality is slipping faster than the clutch on my dads 1981 VW Jetta!",xwlbjp

Big jump from they don't exist to we have huge respect for them,xwlbjp
Wow did we create our language in just 8 month? Didn’t he say that it is just a dialect not a language previously? 🤡,xwlbjp
"I would add for people who do not understand russian language putin is saying not “Ukraine”, but “the Ukraine” as if referring not to a country but to a region.",xwlbjp
"What kinda human being do you have to be to be able to sit there, and spew such complete BS, when you’re the cause of so much death, sorrow, and pain.

"Is ruZZia lyin?

Yes.",xwlbjp
Ukraine are amazing for standing up to a nutter like Putin,xwlbjp
He loves Ukraine so much that he wanted Russia to be apart of it by force,xwlbjp
(X) Doubt,xwlbjp
"Liar, as always",xwlbjp
The moment he’s talking about respect for Ukraine he starts scribbling on the paper is a classic tell of someone lying and who means completely the opposite of what they’re saying,xwlbjp
looks like he's reading a prepared speech like a good little boy.,xwlbjp
What a fucking lizard bitch.,xwlbjp
Keeping the shaky right hand busy scribbling  like a two year old,xwlbjp
"Haha, respect?! Are you serious, that is a bullshit 🤣",xwlbjp
All the BS respect while signing a useless decree to illegally steal land???,xwlbjp
"He said “respect” and in the next sentence he said “on Ukraine”, which means that is Ukraine is not an independent country. What a mess.",xwlbjp
So Ukrainians went from Nazis to great people with great culture. Things change pretty quick when you’re getting absolutely dominated on the battlefield. He’s trying to save face now.,xwlbjp
This is too good,xwlbjp
"-kanye west say

Me : ok don't care",xwlbjp
Fuck this lying piece of shit,xwlbjp
He is so out of his mind...,xwlbjp
"I don’t think this war is against Ukraine and their people, but more against nato and usa , Ukraine government is just Good in manipulation of situation",xwlbjp
I just want to know what he's scribbling tbh,xwlbjp
Hmm am i seeing his nose getting longer and longer,xwlbjp
He loves Ukraines literature so much that he issues his soldiers with field combat manuals written by Ukrainian men in the 60s lol,xwlbjp
"”*We’ll treat you with respect as long as you’ll submit to our rule, pillaging, terrorizing, cultural genocide, rapings and summary executions of your children in front of you. Do we have a deal?*”",xwlbjp
He has so much respect for Ukraine that he decided to have genocide there.,xwlbjp
What,xwlbjp
He lies more easily than he breathes,xwlbjp
"Fu*k you Putler, you don't respect anything or anyone. And no one respects you.",xwlbjp
"No respect for this arsehole. 
Let's be very precise here that is all he is an arsehole and all he ever was no use to humanity whatsoever",xwlbjp
Video should be under Iamapieceofshit !,xwlbjp
Is this guy still alive?!,xwlbjp
"Now's the time when you come to think, why would he begin with the ""respect for the ukrainian culture"" speech RIGHT NOW?",xwlbjp

Need to see every Western leader continue to say that.",xwnh90
"it should not contain any territorial concessions,...

thats the only way - because territory is the main metrics that Russians use in war , not human lives,  economy, equipment or something else

in Russian ( and Serbian ) culture territory determines the winner , and as long as any new piece of land goes to Russia - however small - they can sell it as a victory back home",xwnh90
"I was kind of thinking that Belgorod and Kursk oblasts should be held by Ukraine ""In Trust"" until Russia pays all the war reparations it owes Ukraine. That sounds  like a fair deal to me.",xwnh90
"No territorial concessions on Ukraines part. But I think their should be some punishment for Russian aggression, just like Germany lost significant territory in WW2 Russia needs to lose territory as punishment for their aggression. I like the idea of Kaliningrad going to Poland and Lithuania. Everything between Ukraine and the Caspian south of Volgograd is ceded to  Ukraine. Either that or maintain the sanctions until Russia completely disarms turning all its nuclear arsenal over to NATO for destruction.",xwnh90

700k people just left the country after the mobilization order. They should have all just marched on Moscow.,xwkql3
"These guys have not had the full training. If they had, they would simply break into someone's house, steal their food, rape the women and sleep in their beds.",xwkql3
It's as if they've all sobered up and realised they're fucked. Just get back on that train and go home. Oh what? Putin didn't buy you a return ticket?,xwkql3

"I honestly think attacking Kherson is the wrong move here.. It was super important to block Russia to reach and cross at Mykolaiv.. But to take a frontal assault on Kherson could be costly.. And then, the Ukr army will have to cross the Dnipro.. costly also.

If you want to take Kherson for free and attack Crimea, A push from the east is better : Orikhiv -> Tokmak -> Melitopol  And then rushing west.. 

You'll catch the Russian from behind.. So they have to cross the Dnipro to flee and not the Ukr army.",xwu51o

For the entirety of this counter offensive after the Ukraine Army takes a town, it can leave.  The people in the town support the army and Ukraine.  They don't need to be watched or monitored. They just need help getting back to living a normal life.  So the whole of the army can go on and fight forward.   
If the people living in Crimea are this supportive, then yes.  But if there are people that are not supportive, then the task becomes much more difficult.  So far all of the partisan activity has been for Ukraine.  I hope it stays that way in Crimea.",xwu51o
"How about we get to the bridges first ... or Melitopol, Berdjansk and Mariupol. Step by step. Planned, with reserves at the ready. and not in a rush that could lose unnecessary lives and material. 

The term spring offensive for Crimea... sounds good though.",xwu51o
"at this point, Ukraine could make its territory look like it does on the Risk board game, and no could stop them.  The Russian military we thought was and iron bear turned out to be a wet goose.",xwu51o

"So that is actually what you are supposed to do 

( Former infantry Marine here )

Find cover and immediately engage. Don’t just be static. You get a base down then apply fire and movement towards the contact 

He who stays put is quickly fucked

(Now the firing without aiming bullshit is not recommended)",xwkku0
The professionalism in the Ukrainian army is amazing comparing to the 2014 army.,xwkku0
"That was quick, about 10 seconds from the first contact to getting behind cover and sending rounds down range.",xwkku0
Because they are not only better trained but far more fierce (AKA Bad to the bone) than their ruZZian attackers.,xwkku0
"So trained, disciplined and resilient. The UKR Army will be the stuff of legend.",xwkku0
Quick response!! That’s good too see,xwkku0

"Jesus Christ that's insane, I' would have shat myself and drowned in my pee if I were there.",xwkku0
"No. Those were landmines, no direct contact with enemy.",xwkku0
Was the initial blast from the ambush or the tank itself?,xwkku0
Either RPG or anti-tank,xwkku0
"I'd like to see the outcome of this, was it a ambush with rpgs or did they hit mines?

Seems to be more likely rpgs but is their incoming fire directed at them?

Hopefully they pushed the russians if that was the case and got them.",xwkku0
Dumbasses can't even ambush Ukranians correctly lmao,xwkku0
SPACING!!!,xwkku0

TALLINN, Estonia (AP) — Estonia’s prime minister said Tuesday that the West must not give in to Moscow’s nuclear threats or premature peace proposals but stand firmly in support of Ukraine as the invaded country fights to rid its occupied territories of Russian soldiers.

Kaja Kallas, who has led Estonia’s government since last year, told The Associated Press in an interview that “very dangerous” calls for negotiations and peace in Ukraine have come from “very prominent people” lately.

She didn’t specify anyone by name, but her comments came a day after Tesla CEO Elon Musk floated on Twitter a proposal for ending the war that elicited fierce opposition from Kyiv.

Musk, who has been involved in an on and off and reportedly on again deal to buy the social media platform, argued that Russia should be allowed to keep the Crimean Peninsula that it seized in 2014. The four regions Russia annexed following Kremlin-orchestrated “referendums” last month should hold repeat votes organized by the United Nations, he said.",xwt7k7
"It sounds like the nations of the former Soviet Bloc have a more realistic assessment of Russia after having been occupied by them since WWII ended.  Even though their economies are relatively small compared to those of France, Germany, and the UK, they are giving as much aid to Ukraine as they can afford.",xwt7k7

"Gotta be honest, I’m having a hard time seeing what exactly the gun is doing. The drone is just descending?",xwcb6p
"The gun jams way more than just the control link, it can locally disrupt the GPS and other GNSS navigation signals used by the drone to fix its position.  If you only knock out the control link the drones are programmed to return to a specified waypoint.  If you knock out both the control link AND the nav sat signals then the default behavior is to slowly land.  At this point you just have to grab it, pull the battery and add it to your collection.",xwcb6p

One shot + one kill = one donated Z vehicle.,xwoio5
What is that flag they are holding?,xwoio5
Героям слава!,xwoio5
"Every ""Z"" vehicle belongs to Ukraine, Ukrainians are claiming what's theirs. 

I remember reading somewhere that the true meaning behind the letters ""V"" and ""Z"" that Ruzzians so proudly put on their vehicles/buildings/etc. actually mean Ukraine president's name initials (Volodymyr Zelenskyy), hidden in plain sight as silent support to Ukraine and an anonymous 'fuck you' to Kremlin's regime.

If that's really true, then it would be sweet to see Russian sites trolled with memes about this non-stop. ""Another tank/vehicle/etc returned to Zelenskyy"", ""Another vehicle marked to belong to Zelenskyy's people"", ""One more vehicle marked for delivery/donation to Zelenskyy's soldiers"" and so on. 

Whatever the case, Ukrainian flag on a vehicle still looks a thousand times better than any letters.

Slava Ukraini!",xwoio5

The Russian military is scraping *through* the bottom of the barrel for sufficient ~~crap~~ material to equip the latest round of ~~press-ganged~~ mobilized troops for the ~~war~~ special military effort.  Those foot wraps probably date back to the USSR days.,xwk581
