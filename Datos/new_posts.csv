"On October 12th, 2022: President of the European Parliament, Roberta Metsola, hosted women Speakers of EU Parliaments „to discuss increased support to our Ukrainian friends. More humanitarian support to displaced families is needed. We can provide that. Solidarity with Ukraine can go further.“•",66,y2mbcm,RussiaUkraineWar2022,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/y2mbcm,2,"„War crimes can never be committed with impunity.

Speech of Roberta Metsola: regarding the Russian invasion of Ukraine ⬇️

Dear colleagues, Dear friends, Welcome to the European Parliament. It is a pleasure to have you all here for our third meeting of Women Speakers of Parliaments of the European Union. 

Thank you to my counterpart Madame Speaker Pekarova Adamova representing the Czech Presidency for the great cooperation in co-organising today’s meeting. And thank you Madame Speaker Witek for your efforts in initiating this important forum. In your intervention in the first Women Speakers’ meeting in Warsaw you said that if you want to get something done, ask a woman. I couldn’t agree with you more. 


Today will continue our discussions on how we can practically support Ukrainians who are temporarily residing in our Union. Firstly, let me say how immensely proud I am that our countries, our regions, our local authorities and our citizens have opened up their borders, their homes and their hearts to Ukrainians fleeing Russia’s brutal invasion. We all know the hardships they are going through. 


I particularly recall a very emotional and difficult meeting I had with displaced Ukrainians in Otwock School Warsaw, upon my return from Kyiv. It keeps reminding me just how important our support is to millions of Ukrainians who have been forced to flee from their country. The European Union has had - and continues to have - a very strong and united approach against Putin’s illegal and unprovoked war. 


We remain steadfast in our support towards Ukraine and we will continue to provide the political, humanitarian and military support needed to preserve Ukraine’s sovereignty, independence and territorial integrity. The European Parliament has gone further in its practical support by hosting the Ukrainian Civil Society Hub in its premises, by providing truckloads of IT equipment to the Verkhovna Rada and by reaching out to 160 Parliaments across the world to rally them towards Ukraine’s cause.  


At the start of the war, Putin thought he would divide us. But he was wrong. Instead, his war brought the European Union - the entire democratic community - closer together. Because we know that Ukraine is not only fighting a territorial war but also a war to preserve our values.  


We can do more. We need to do more. When I met with First Lady of Ukraine Olena Zelenska at the European Parliament last month, she expressed her concern over the disproportionate impact of the war on Ukrainian women and children.  Dear colleagues, this forum has the unique potential to initiate means of support to our Ukrainian friends. 

Whether that is through initiatives aimed at: 

• giving stronger protection against the trafficking and exploitation of displaced children and young people, or 

• guaranteeing psychological support in the Ukrainian language, or  


• better addressing the needs of displaced children with disabilities, or  


• providing scholarships to students, or  


• boosting investments in quality jobs and social support for parents and young people, I firmly believe that our solidarity can go further still. My hope for our meeting today is to open new avenues for our cooperation and to give us the renewed impetus that we need in these extraordinarily challenging times.",1665626357.0

"“I was born under Soviet occupation. I was a generation that was living without freedom. So I am not taking it for granted and I understand its value,” the Prime Minister of Estonia, Kaja Kallas told The Telegraph: as she warned West not to negotiate with 'war criminal' Putin. (continued ⬇️)",804,y02n80,RussiaUkraineWar2022,https://i.redd.it/87fm1fvtyvs91.jpg,28,"Kaja Kallas’ mother was only six months old when Soviet guards loaded her onto a cattle truck and deported her to a prison camp in Siberia. She would not return to Estonia until she was ten.  


Today, her daughter is Estonia’s prime minister and Europe’s strongest voice against any reconciliation of Vladimir Putin, whom she calls a “terrorist” and a “criminal” who should be tried in international courts for war crimes.  She was the first leader to congratulate Ukraine on the destruction of a key bridge connecting Russia and annexed Crimea on Saturday, even though Kiev had not claimed responsibility for the strike.  “Ukraine must win this war,” Ms Kallas told The Telegraph in Prague, Czech Republic, at a European summit where she renewed her demands for more sanctions against Moscow and more weapons for Kiev. 


No other country in the world has sent more military equipment to Ukraine as a percentage of GDP per capita than Estonia – a small Baltic nation of just 1.3 million inhabitants, bordering Russia and only moving beyond the Iron Gate in 1991. Curtain to independence came.  Estonia was also one of the few countries to send weapons to Kiev before Putin’s illegal invasion on February 24.  


It is not for nothing that Estonia’s first female prime minister, who calls the cold warrior Margaret Thatcher ‘an inspiration’, has been called the new ‘iron lady’ of Europe.  She has warned Russians fleeing Putin’s conscription in Ukraine that Estonia will reject their asylum applications. Instead, they should stay at home and overthrow their president, she says.  She wants the EU to ban Russian tourists and for Ukraine to join NATO. 



She invests in the Estonian army and for more weapons for Kyiv.  Ms Kallas, a 45-year-old mother of three, stood out in her blue dress among Europe’s 44, mostly male, biggest political beasts for the first-ever meeting of the European Political Community in Prague on Thursday.  “Russia is terrorizing us so that we back away from our decisions,” she said, referring to Putin’s threat of nuclear war.


“When it comes to Putin, of course he is a war criminal and should be prosecuted for the crimes of aggression he committed,” she said during a pause in the talks in the immaculate gardens of Prague Castle.  ‘And you shouldn’t negotiate with terrorists, because it pays for them. In the long run, we will pay a higher price.”  Ms Kallas had criticized France and Germany for pushing for an early peace deal earlier in the conflict.  She admits she is still “concerned” that Ukraine could be forced into “a premature peace that they are not really ready for” by Western allies. 



The West had a “very different understanding” of what peace could mean for the former Iron Curtain countries, she said.  “For half of Europe, the end of World War II meant peace, it meant prosperity,” she said. “On the other side of Europe, peace meant atrocities, torture and mass deportations.”",1665367414.0

It should have water, a phone, a toy, and a change of clothes. From the first grade, children should know where the bomb shelter is and how to act when something happens. This is not what you want to teach children, especially first-graders,” she said. 


The Ukrainian President’s wife spoke about the daily bombing of peaceful Ukrainian cities by the Russian occupiers: “They are waging war against the civilian population, using scorched earth tactics. From a moral and ethical point of view, this is not a modern war, but a medieval one.” The first lady thanked the American people for their support and emphasized the need for its continuation. “Every delay in aid means lost lives,” Zelenska said. 


The President’s wife also spoke about the National Program of Mental Health and Psychosocial Support, which should help Ukrainians overcome the consequences of the war and return to normal life. For this purpose, Ukrainian mental health specialists undergo special training, in particular abroad – in Israel, Belgium, and the United States. “During these months, our society has developed a stable understanding that a person should be at the center of everything. We help each other a lot. I think we will not lose it, but only multiply it. All social and political processes in the country must be people-centric,” Zelenska is convinced. 


The First Lady of Ukraine also addressed the residents of the temporarily occupied territories of Ukraine: “Do not lose faith that we will return you and that we are waiting for you. We will never betray our people.”",1665212228.0
