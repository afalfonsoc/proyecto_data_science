As a result, Russian servicemen were killed, military equipment turned into piles of scrap metal, and the BC flew into the air

Also, according to intelligence, all the machinists and engineers of the Russian Railways company, who transported military cargo from Crimea to the Kherson region, died

‚Äú‚ö°Ô∏èüá¨üáßüá∫üá¶ Battle for Kherson: the situation in the Andreevsky and Berislav sectors as of 15.00 October 4, 2022 In the north-east of the Kherson region, the RF Armed Forces regrouped. Due to the breakthrough of the Armed Forces of Ukraine in the Berislav sector and the threat of the physical encirclement of the Russian group from the villages of Dudchany and Davydov Broda, a decision was made to withdraw the contingent of the RF Armed Forces to a new line of defense. ‚ñ™Ô∏èIn addition to Brod, Russian units left Bolshaya and Malaya Aleksandrovka, Staroselye, Trifonovka, Novaya Kamenka, Olgino and Arkhangelskoye. It is not yet entirely clear how the new contact zone will pass. We assume that today the RF Armed Forces will be stationed at the Kostromka - Borozenskoye - Mylovoe line. This will avoid creating a ""cauldron"" and level the front line. üîªFrom the point of view of the impossibility of holding the defense in the Krivoy Rog sector, this is the only acceptable option for preserving personnel and equipment. However, the absence of any retaliatory actions and counteroffensives in the near future will create a threat of a further offensive of the Armed Forces of Ukraine on Berislav and Novaya Kakhovka, as well as Kherson from the Posad-Pokrovsky and Snigirevsky sectors. In addition, the control of the Armed Forces of Ukraine over the coast of the Dnieper River is an immediate danger to the Russian contingent on the left bank of the Dnieper. Ukrainian units, provided there is no opposition, will be able to carry out a landing operation using small boats and boats, of which they have enough. And this is already a blow to the flank of the grouping of the RF Armed Forces in the Zaporozhye region and a direct exit to Melitopol. Solving this problem should be a top priority and requires an immediate response.‚Äù",1664889875.0

This is reported by the ""Bild am Sonntag"" (BamS).

According to the newspaper, a comrade of Bj√∂rn C. said: ""We were stationed in the east of Kharkiv."" The fighter, also a European volunteer, said: ""On May 31, we moved into our observation post there. I had the first shift, took a break, then it was Bj√∂rn's turn.""

Russian drones have been circling over the village throughout the day. ""We could hear the buzzing overhead, it's a horrible sound because you know what's going to follow.""

In the afternoon the Russian artillery shells had hit quite indiscriminately, but then they had systematically worked their way forward, the comrade reported. ""Around 6:30 p.m., an artillery shell hit the house where our post was."" Bj√∂rn C. was seriously injured by shrapnel. With other comrades he wanted to take him to a field hospital. ""It was too late, almost two hours later he was already dead.""

Bj√∂rn C. (left of the picture) was very popular within the unit. ""He was always kind to everyone, one of the best people I knew. He was big and strong, that's why we called him Panzer\*""

\*Panzer = Tank

Bj√∂rn C. apparently wanted to go back to Brandenburg. ""He had submitted his application that evening, the next day he would have had a few days off,"" the comrade told the newspaper. ""He then wanted to go home for good within the next two months, he missed his girlfriend, his child and his dog.""

Currently living in Kazakhstan. Protesters can't do anything to make life in Russia better. The government has a powerful opression mechanism and sadly there are still many brainwashed russians. Many protesters gived up. Now they are just sitting in homes and praying for Ukraine's victory. Some protesters are sended to SIZOs (aka gulags), and others leaved Russia. Sadly, only few emigrants are finally found new home and well settled. Many russian emigrants can't achieve a place in other countries and are forced to return to Russia. I read about it in Meduza, a russian opposition news media located in Lithuania. And I have fear that my nation would be isolated in Russia under totalitarian dictatorship for decades. That's why Ukraine should win. Because it's the only way to liberate russian people from tyranny, and of course, save innocent lives of ukrainian civilians. It's a tragedy how current regime in one day ruined rich culture and language of my nation, which is now developed a ""slave mentality"". I just want a freedom to my people and peace between nations. People in Russia are helpless in situation. It's impossible to make a revolution. Only Ukraine's triumph will somehow inspire and force russians to overthrow the current regime. If not this will happen, we will be stuck in hell for decades and the situation will only get much worse. I heard news how kids in school handed over the teacher to police because she said anti-war speeches. It says how propaganda works well in Russia.
